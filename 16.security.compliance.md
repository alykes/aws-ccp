Check this link: https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/ 

`Exam Tip`: Will get about 2 or 3 questions about this section in the exam  

### DDos Protection : WAF & Shield  

**What is DDoS?**  
Distributed Denial of Serice Attack on a server/service  

**How can you protect yourself?**  
- `AWS Shield Standard`: enabled on all AWS accounts at no additional cost  
- `AWS Shield Advanced`: 24/7 premium DDoS protection  
- `AWS WAF`: Filter specific requests based on rules  
- `Cloudfront and Route 53`:  
  - Availability protection using the global edge network  
  - Combined with AWS Shield to provide attack mitigation at the edge  
- Leverage with `AWS Auto Scaling` to help mitigate the attack  

### AWS Shield  
- **AWS Shield Standard**  
  - Free service that is activated for every AWS customer  
  - Provides protection from attacks such as SYN/UDP floods, reflection attacks and other L3/L4 attacks  
- **AWS Shield Advanced**  
  - Optional DDoS mitigation service (expensive ~$3k a month per org)  
  - Protection against sophisticated attacks on _EC2, ELB, Cloudfront, Global Accelerator and Route 53_    
  - 24/7 access to AWS DDoS reponse team (DRP)  
  - Protect against higher fees during usage spikes due to DDoS  

### AWS WAF  
- Protects web applications from common web exploits (Layer 7)  
- Layer 7 is HTTP (Layer 4 is TCP)  
- Deploy on **Application Load Balancers, API Gatewys or Cloudfront**  
- Define Web ACL (Web Access Control Lists)  
  - Rules can include **IP Addresses**, HTTP Headers, HTTP body or URI strings  
  - Protects from common attacks - SQL Injection and XSS (Cross Site Scripting)  
  - Size Constraints, geo-matching (to block countries)  
  - Rate-based rules (to count occurrences of events) - DDoS protection  

### AWS Network Firewall  
- Protect your entire Amazon VPC  
- From Layer 3 to Layer 7  
- Any direction, you can inspect:  
  - VPC to VPC traffic  
  - Outbound to internet  
  - Inbound from internet  
  - To/From Direct Connect & Site-to-Site VPN  

### AWS Firewall Manager
- `Exam Tip` Allows you to manage security rules in all accounts of an AWS Organisation  
- Security Policy (Common set of security rules):  
  - VPC Security Groups for EC2, App Load Balancers, etc  
  - WAF Rules  
  - AWS Shield Advanced  
  - AWS Network Firewall  
- Rules are applied to new resources as they are created across all and future accounts in your Org (which is great for compliance!)  

## Penetration Testing  
- Attack your own infrastructure **without prior approval** on the following services:  
    - EC2, NAT Gateway and ELB  
    - RDS  
    - CloudFront  
    - Aurora  
    - API Gateway  
    - Lambda and Lambda Edge function  
    - Lightsail  
    - Elastic Beanstalk  
- Prohibited Activities:  
    - DNS Zone walking via Route53 Hosted Zones  
    - DoS, DDoS, Simulated DoS or Simulated DDoS  
    - Port flooding  
    - Protocol flooding  
    - Request flooding (login request flooding, API request flooding)  
    - Anything that looks like an attack  
    - For other simulated events, contact aws-security-simulated-event@amazon.com for approval   

### Encryption with KMS and CloudHSM  
- **Data at Rest vs Data in Transit**  
  - `at-rest` means that it's not moving and is written somewhere; RDS, Glacier Deep Archive
  - `in-transit` is when the data is in motion, moving from one location to another (over the network); Web Server traffic to an RDS instance  
  - Encrypt data in both states to protect it  
  - Encryption is done via encryption keys  

- `AWS KMS (Key Management Service)`  
  - KMS means that AWS manages the keys for you  
  - Some services allow you to opt-into this encryption:  
    - EBS volumes
    - S3 bucket  
    - Redshift DB  
    - RDS DB  
    - EFS Drive  
  - Encryption is automatically enabled on the following services:  
    - Cloudtrail Logs  
    - S3 Glacier  
    - Storage Gateway  

- `CloudHSM`  
  - KMS means that AWS manages by software encryption  
  - CloudHSM: AWS provisions encryption hardware  
  - Dedicated Hardware (HSM; `Hardware Security Module`)  
  - You manage your own encryption keys entirely (not managed by AWS)  
  - HSM device is tamper resistant, FIPS 140-2 Level 3 compliance  

- `CMK (Customer Master Keys)`  
  - **Cusomter managed CMK**:  
    - Create, Manage and used by the customer, can be enabled or disabled  
    - Posibility of rotation policy (new keys generated every year, old keys are preserved)  
    - Posibility to bring your own  
  - **AWS managed CMK**:  
    - Created, managed and used on the customer's behalf by AWS  
    - Used by AWS Services (s3, ebs, redshift)    
  - **AWS owned CMK**:  
    - Collection of CMKs that an AWS Service owns and manages to use in multiple accounts  
    - AWS can use those to protect resources in your account but you can't view the keys  
  - **CloudHSM Keys (custom keystore)**:    
    - Keys generated from your own CloudHSM hardware device  
    - Cryptographic operations are performed within the CloudHSM cluster  

- `AWS Certifacte Manager (ACM)`  
  - Provision, manage and deploy SSL/TLS Certificates  
  - used to provision in-flight encryption for websites (https)  
  - supports both public and private TLS certs  
  - automatic cert renewals

  - Used to store secrets  
  - Capability to force rotation of secrets every **x** days  
  - auto-generate secrets on rotation (uses lambda)  
  - integration with Amazon RDS (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Aurora)  
  - secrets are encrypted using KMS  
  - Mostly meant for RDS integration but you can store any other secret in there as well  
  - `Exam Tip`: If you see a question about rotating keys for RDS and where it will be stored, think **AWS Secrets Manager**  

- `Artifact`  
  - **Portal that provides customers with on-demand access to AWS compliance documentation and AWS agreements**  
    - Artifact Reports - You can download security and compliance documents from 3rd party auditors, ISO certs, SOC reports, PCI reports  
    - Artifact Agreements - review, accept and track status of AWS agreements such as BAA, HIPAA etc  
  - Can be used to support internal audit or compliance  

- `GuardDuty`  
  - Intelligent Threat Discovery to protect your AWS account
  - Uses ML anomaly detection and 3rd party data  
  - One-Click to enable it, there is a 30 day trial. No software to install  
  - Input data includes:  
    - `CloudTrail Event Logs` - Unusual API calls, unauthorised deployments    
      - `CloudTrail management Events` - create VPC subnet, create trails  
      - `CloudTrail S3 Data Events` - get object, list objects, delete object  
    - `VPC Flow Logs` - unusual internal traffic, unusual IP Address  
    - `DNS Logs` - compromised EC2 instance sending encoded data within DNS queries  
    - `Optional Features` - EKS Audit Logs, RDS & Aurora, EBS, Lambda, S3 Data Events

    - Assessment of functions as they are deployed  
- Reporting integration with Security Hub  
- You can send findings to Amazon Event Bridge  

**What does Amazon Inspector evaluate?**  
- only EC2 instances, container images and Lambda functions can be inspected  
- continuous scanning of infra is done but only when needed  
- package vulnerabilities are checked against a database of CVE  
- network reachability is checked  
- a risk score is associated with all vulnerabilities for prioritisation
