## Section 21 - Architecting & ecosystem  

### AWS Whitepapers Well-Architected Framework  

- **General Guiding Principles**  
  - Stop guessing your capacity needs  
  - test systems at production scale  
  - automate to make architectual experimentation easier  
  - allow for evolutionary architecture  
    - design based on changing requirements  
  - drive architecture using data  
  - improve through game days  
    - simulate applications for flash sale days  

- **AWS Cloud Best Practises - Design Principles**  
  - `Scalability`: vertical & horizontal  
  - `Disposbale Resources`: servers should be disposable & easily configured  
  - `Automation`: Serverless, infrastructure as a Service, Auto-Scaling  
  - `Loose Coupling`:  
    - _Monoliths_ are applications that do more and more over time, becoming larger  
    - Break it down into smaller, loosely couple components  
    - A change or a failure in one component should not cascade to other components  
  - `Services, not servers`:  
    - Don't just use EC2  
    - Use managed services, databases, serverless etc  

- ${\color{lightblue}{\textsf{The 6 pillars of the Well-Architected Framework}}}\$  
  1. `Operational Excellence`  
  1. `Security`  
  1. `Reliability`  
  1. `Performance Efficiency`  
  1. `Cost Optimisation`  
  1. `Sustainability`  

  **The pillars are not something you want to balance or trade-off against, they are all synergetic**

  - `Test Recovery Procedures`: Use automation to simulate different failures or to recreate scenarios that led to previous failures  
  - `Automatically recover from failure`: Anticipate and remediate failures before they occur  
  - `Scale horzontally to increase aggregate system availability`: Distribute requests across multiple, smaller resources to ensure that they don't share a common point of failure

### AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF)  
`Exam Tip` You will need to memorise some things in this section... :vomiting_face:  

- CAF is a whitepaper, not a service  
- Helps you build and then execute a comprehensive plan for your digital transformation through innovative use of AWS  
- Created by AWS Professionals by taking advantage of AWS Best Practises and lessons learned from 1000s of customers  
- AWS CAF identifies specific organisational capabilities that underpin successful clooud transformations  
- AWS CAF groups it capabilities in six perspectives (`remember these perspectives`):  
  - `Business`  
  - `People`  
  - `Governance`  
  - `Platform`  
  - `Security`  
  - `Operations`  

They can be grouped into two overarching categories:  
- **Business Capabilities**  
  - `Business Perspective`: helps ensure that your cloud investments accelerate your digital transformation ambitions and business outcomes  
  - `People Perspective`: serves **as a bridge between technology and business** accelerating the cloud journey to help organisations more rapidly evolve to a culture of continuous growth, learning and where change becomes business-as-usual, with focus on culture, organisational structure, leadership and workforce  
  - `Governance Perspective`: helps you orchestrate your cloud initiatives while maximising organisational benefits and minimising transformation related risks  

- **Technical Capabilities**  
  - `Platform Perspective`: helps you build an enterprise grade, scalable, hybrid cloud platform; modernising existing workloads; implementing new cloud-native solutions  
  - `Security Perspective`: helps you achieve the confidentiality, integrity and availability (`CIA`) of you data and cloud workloads  
  - `Operations Perspective`: helps ensure that you cloud services are delivered at a level that meets the needs of your business  

- **AWS CAF - Transformation Domains**  
  - `Technology`: using the cloud to migrate and modernise legacy infrastructure, applications, data and analytic platforms  
  - `Process`: digitising, automating and optimising your business operations  
    - leverage new data and analytics platforms to create actionable insights  
    - using machine learning (ML) to improve your customer service experience  
  - `Organisation`: Reimaging your operating model  
    - Organise teams around products and value streams  
    - ${\color{lightblue}{\textsf{leverage agile methods to rapidly iterate and evolve}}}\$  
  - `Product`: reimagining your business model by creating new value propositions (products and services) and revenue models  

- **AWS CAF - Transformation Phases**  
  - `Envision`: demonstrate how the cloud will accelerate business outcomes by identifying transformation opportunities and create a foundation for your digital transformation  
  - `Align`: identify capability gaps across the 6 AWS CAF Perspectives which results in an Action Plan  
  - `Launch`: build and deliver pilot initiatives in production and demonstrate incremental business value  
  - `Scale`: expand pilot initiatives to the desired scale while realising the desired business benefits  

### Right Sizing  
- EC2 has many instance types but choosing the most powerful instance type isn't the best choice because the cloud is ${\color{lightblue}{\textsf{elastic}}}\$  
- Right sizing is the process of matching instance types and sizes to your workload performance and capacity requirements ${\color{lightblue}{\textsf{at the lowest possible cost}}}\$  
- ${\color{lightblue}{\textsf{Scaling up is easy so always start small}}}\$  
- It's also the process of looking at deployed instances and identifying opportunities to eliminate or downsize without compromising capacity or other requirements which results in lower costs  
- It's important to ${\color{lightblue}{\textsf{right-size}}}\$  
  - _before a cloud migration_  
  - _continuously after the cloud onboarding process (requirements change over time)_  
- CloudWatch, Cost Explorer, Trusted Advisor, 3rd party tools can help
