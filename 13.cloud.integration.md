## Section 13 - Cloud Integration  
When we start deploying multiple applications, it will be inevitable that they will need to communicate with each other  
There are two patterns of application communication  
  1. `Synchronous communication`
     - Application to Application  
     - When you have one service directly talking to another service  
  1. `Asynchronous Communication`  
     - Usually when there is a **queue** in between two services, they each communicate separately  
     - The services are *decoupled* from each other  

Reasons to decouple applications:  
  - If there are sudden or unpredictable spikes in traffic  
  - If there is sudden demand on the server, such as a spike in compute  
It can be better to decouple the applications and:  
  - use `SQS`: which is a `Queue` model  
  - use `SNS`: which is a `publication/subscription` model  
  - use `kinesis`: `real-time data streaming` model  

**NOTE: Once services are decoupled, they can scale independently from the application.**    

### SQS - Short Queing Service  
**What is a queue?**    
- A single `Producer` or multiple `Producers` send messages into a queue  
- A single `Consumer` or multiple `Consumers` read messages from a queue  

Once a consumer processes the message, it is deleted from the queue  

- This is the oldest offering (over 10 years old)  
- Fully managed service and is used to decouple applications  
- Scales from 1 message per second to 10,000s per second  
- Default retention is 4 days up to a maximum of 14 days  
- No limit to how many messages are in a queue  
- **Messages are deleted after they are read by consumers**  
- Low latency; less than 10ms on publish and receive  
- **Consumers share the work to read messages and can scale horizontally**  

**SQS decouples application tiers**  
- Example  
  - Users want to process videos  
  - There are web servers in an ASG and video processing workers in another ASG  
  - A queue sits in the middle  
  - Users put in requests on the web servers  
  - The requests are published to the queue  
  - The Video Processing workers read the queue and process the jobs  
  - Once the job is complete, the workers delete the message from the queue  
**This completely decouples each tier and therefore they are more easily scalable**  

**FIFO Queues**  
First In First Out; First message in the queue is the first message out of the queue  
Messages are processed in order by the `consumer`  

**Standard Queues**  
Ordering is a best effort  
Guarantees that the message will arrive to the queue at least once   

**Hands On**  
You can test the queue by clicking `Send and Receive Messages`  
You can then click on `Poll` messages to receive the messages  

- Messages have three parts:  
  - `Body`  
  - `Attributes`  
  - `Details`  

### Kinesis  
`Exam Tip`: Kinesis is real-time big data streaming  
Managed service to collect, process and analyse the real-time streaming data at scale

There are different types of streams:  
- `Kinesis Data Streams`: low latency streaming to ingest data at scale from hundreds of thousands of sources  
- `Kinesis Data Firehose`: load streams into S3, redshift, elasticsearch etc...    
- `Kinesis Data Analytics`: perform real-time analytics on streams using SQL  
- `Kinesis Video Streams`: monitor real-time video streams for analytics or ML  

**High Level Architecture**    
Clickstreams - IoT Devices - Metrics & Logs --> Kinesis Streams --> Kinesis Analytics --> Kinesis Firehose --> S3 or RedShift  

### SNS - Short Notification Service   
Simple Notification Service
One message to many receivers  
Uses a Pub/Sub model  
Create SNS Topics and users/services then subscribe to the topics  

- The "event publishers" only sends messages to one SNS topic  
- As many "event subscribers" as we want to listen to the SNS topic notifications  
- Each subscriber to the topic will get all the messages  
- Up to 12.5 millions sub per topic, there is a 10k limit to topics
- Send to SQS, Lambda, Kinesis Firehose, email, sms & mobile notifications or HTTP(s) endpoints  

### Amazon MQ - Messaging Queue  
SQS, SNS are "cloud Native" services: proprietary protocols from AWS  

**Traditional applications** running on-prem may use open protocols such as: MQTT, AMQP, STOMP, OpenWire, WSS  

**When migrating to the cloud**, instead of re-engineering the application to use SQS and SNS, you can use Amazon MQ  
Amazon MQ is a managed message broker service for: `RabbitMQ` and `ActiveMQ`  
Amazon MQ doesn't scale as much as SQS and SNS  
Amazon MQ runs on servers, can run in multi-az with failover  
Amazon MQ has both queue features (~SQS) and topic features (~SNS)  


### Summary  
- `SQS`:  
  - queue service in AWS  
  - Pull based
  - multiple producers, messages kept up to **14 days**  
  - multiple consumers share the reads and the messages are deleted when done  
  - used to decouple applications in AWS  
- `SNS`:  
  - Notification in AWS  
  - Push based  
  - Subscribers: email, lambda, SQS, HTTP, mobile  
  - Multiple Subscribers, sends messages to all subscribers  
  - No message retention  
- `Kinesis`: real-time data streaming, persistence and analysis  
- `Amazon MQ`: managed service broker for ActiveMQ and RabbitMQ in the cloud (MQTT, AMQP protocols)
