## Section 7 - Elastic Load Balancing & Auto-Scaling Groups  
 
### High Availability, Scalability
Basically means a system can handle or adapt to greater on-demand workloads.  

There are two types of scalability:  
- Vertical (beefer hardware)  
- Horizontal (aka elasticity)  

Scalability is linked but different to High Availability  

**Vertical Scaling**  
Increase the size of the instance, more RAM, more CPU etc  
Change the size of the instance (eg t2.micro to t2.large)  
Vertical scaling is limited to the largest instance size that is available (Hardware limit)  

**Horizontal Scalability**  
Add additional instances or systems to cater to what you need  
Horizontal scaling implies a distributed system  
Very common with web apps  


**High Availability**  
Goes hand in hand with horizontal scaling  
Running in at least 2 AZs  
Goal is to handle a disaster (eg, loss of an AZ)  

**High Availability and Scalability in EC2**  
- `Vertical Scaling`: Increase the instance size (scale up or down)  
  - from t2.nano - 0.5GB RAM, 1 vCPU  
  - to u-12tbl.metal - 12.3TB RAM, 448 vCPU  
- `Horizontal Scaling`: Increase the number of instances (scale in or out)  
  - Auto Scaling Groups  
  - Load Balancers  
- `High Availability`: Run instances for the same application across multiple AZs  
  - Auto Scaling Groups Multi AZ  
  - Load Balancers Multi AZ  

**Scalability vs Elasticity (vs Agility)**  
`EXAM TIPS`  
- `Scalability`: is the ability to accomodate a larger load by making the hardware stronger (scale up) or by adding nodes (scale out).  
- `Elasticity`: once a system is scalable, elasticity means there will be some **auto-scaling** so that the system can scale based on the workload. This is **cloud-friendly**, that is, pay-per-use, match demand and optimise costs  
- `Agility`: (not related to scalability - it is a distractor) new IT resources are only a click awy, which means that you reduce the time to make those resources available to your developers from weeks to minutes.  

### Elastic Load Balancing Overview  
Load Balancer is a server that will forward internet traffic to multiple servers (EC2 instances) that are downstream. They are also known as backend EC2 instances.  

**Why would you use a load balancer?**  
- Spread load across multiple downstream instances  
- Expose a single point of access (DNS) for your application  
- Seamlessly handle failures of downstream instances  
- Do regular health checks for your instances  
- Provide SSL termination (HTTPs) for websites  
- High Availability across AZs  

**Why use an ELB - Elastic Load Balancer?**  
- An ELB is a managed load balancer  
  - AWS guarantees that it will be working  
  - AWS takes care of the upgraades, maintenance, HA  
  - AWS only provides a few configurations settings to the customer  
- Initially it costs less to set up your own Load Balancer but maintenance, integrations etc will add operational costs  
- 4 kinds ofload balancers offerred by AWS:
  - `Application Load Balancer` (HTTP/HTTPs only) - Layer 7  
  - `Network Load Balancer` (ultra-high performance, allows TCP/UDP - does TLS offloading as well) - Layer 4  
  - `Gateway Load Balancer` - (IP Protocol) Layer 3 - Goes to a 3rd party security server virtual applicances (usually on an EC2 instance) for inspection before returning the packet  
  - `Classic Load Balancer` (retired in 2023) - Layer 4 & 7  

|Application LB|Network LB|Gateway LB|  
|---|---|---|
|HTTP/HTTPS/gRPC (Layer 7)|TCP/UDP (Layer 4)|GENEVE Protocol on IP Packets (Layer 3)|
|HTTP Routing features|High Performance: millions of requests per second|Route Traffic to FW you manage on EC2 instances|
|Static URL (DNS)|Static IP (Elastic IP)|Intrustion detection, deep packet inspection|

### Application Load Balancer  
- To create a load balancer:  
- `EC2` -> `Load Balancing` -> `Load Balancers`  
- `Create Load Balancer` -> Under ALB click `Create`  
- You need to select the AZs that you want the load balancer to send traffic too, anything not selected won't get traffic  
- Create a new `security group` for the Load balancer to allow HTTP/HTTPs traffic through.  
  - Assign it to the ALB  
- Create a `target group` for the instances.  
  - Select the instances and click `Include as pending below`  
  - Select `Create Target Group`  
  - Assign it to the ALB  
- When you click `Create Load Balancer`, view it and wait for it to be ready. There will be a DNS name automatically created for the ALB.  
- Navigate to the DNA name in your browser.  

### Auto-Scaling Group  
ASGs are used when you want to scale in or out  
- In the cloud, you can create and delete instances very quickly  
- The goal of an ASG is to:  
  - Scale out (add instances) to match the increased load  
  - Scale in (remove instances) to match a decreased load  
  - Ensure we have a min and max number of machines running  
  - Automatically register new instances to a load balancer  
  - Replace unhealthy instances  
- Cost Saving: You only run what you need  

Three properties of an ASG are `Min/Desired/Max`  
The ASG works hand in hand with a Load Balancer  

**To create an Auto-Scaling Group**  
- `EC2` -> `Auto Scaling` -> `Auto Scaling Groups` -> `Create Auto Scaling group`  
- You need to create a `launch template`  
    - Select the launch template 
- Under `Choose instance launch options` 
    - Select the AZs that the instances can deploy into  
- Under `Configure advanced options`   
    - Select the Existing Load Balancer  
- Under `Configure group size and scaling policies`  
    - Select `min`, `desired` and `max` settings for the target group  
Then create the ASG and wait for the instances to become healthy  

**Health Checks**  
To change the health checks, you can go to `Target Groups` -> `Health Checks` -> `Edit`  
  - This will allow you to modify some settings under `Advanced Health Check Settings`, such as:  
  - URL, healthy threshold, unhealthy threshold, interval, timeout etc...  

### Auto Scaling Groups - Scaling Strategies  
- `Manual Scaling` - Update the size of the ASG manually  
- `Dynamic Scaling` - Respond to a changing demand  
  - `Simple/Step Scaling` - When a cloudwatch alarm is triggered (eg, CPU > 70%, add instance; CPU < 30% remove an instance)  
  - `Target Tracking Scaling` - When you want the average ASG CPU to stay around 40%  
  - `Scheduled Scaling`
    - Anticipate a scaling based on known usage patterns  
    - eg, increase min cap from 5 to 10 during holidays  
  - `Predictive Scaling` - Uses **machine learning** to predic future traffic ahead of time  
    - Automatically launches EC2 instances ahead of time  
    - Useful when your load has predictable time-based patterns  

### ELB & ASG Summary

- Elastic Load Balancers (ELB)  
  - Distribute traffic across backend EC2 instances, can be multi-AZ  
  - supports health checks  
  - 4 types: `Classic`, `Application(HTTP(s) - L7)`, `Network (TCP/UDP - L4)` and `Gateway (L3)`  
- Auto Scaling Groups (ASG)  
  - Implement Elasticity for you applications across multiple AZ  
  - Scale EC2 uinstances based on the demand on your system, replace unhealthy instances
