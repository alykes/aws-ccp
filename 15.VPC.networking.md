## Section 15 - VPC and Networking  

### Virtual Private Cloud  

The items that will be required knowledge for the exam are:  
  - VPC, subnets, Internet Gateways & NAT Gateways  
  - Security Groups, Network ACL (NACL), VPC Flow Logs  
  - VPC Peering, VPC Endpoints  
  - Site-to-site VPN & Direct Connect  
  - Transit Gateway  

`Exam Tip` You will only get 1 or 2 questions on VPCs  

### IP Addresses in AWS  
- `IPv4`: 4.3 Billion Addresses  
  - Public IPv4 - can be used on the internet  
    - Will refresh everytime you stop and start the instance  
  - Private IPv4 - used on LANs  
    - fixed private IP address for EC2 even if you stop and start the instance  
- `Elastic IP`: allows you to attache a public fixed IP address to your EC2 instance  

- `IPv6`: 3.4x10^38 addresses (a lot! :smile: )  
  - Every address is public, **there are no private ranges**  

### VPC, Subnet, Internet Gateway & NAT Gateways  
`VPC` - regional resource  
   contain  
`Subnets` - AZ resource  

Subnets have `public subnets` (internet accessible) and `private subnets` (only accessible internally)  

To define access to the internet and between subnets, you need to use `route tables`  

- `Internet Gateway` helps VPC instances connect to the internet  
  - The public subnet will have a `route` to the internet gateway  
  - **The Internet Gateway is attached to a VPC**  

- `NAT Gateway managed by AWS & NAT instances(self-managed)` allow your instances in `Private Subnets` to access the internet while remaining private  
  - **The NAT Gateway needs to be created in the public subnet**  
  - A **route** then needs to be created from the _Private Subnet to the NAT gateway_  
  - A **route** also need to be created from the _NAT Gateway to the Internet Gateway_  

  EC2 (Private Subnet) -> Nat GW (Public Subnet) -> Internet Gateway (Edge)  

### Network ACL & Security Groups  

- **Network Access Control List (NACL)**  
  - Are attached at the **subnet** level  
  - Can be associated with multiple subnets
  - A firewall which controls traffic to and from the subnet  
  - Can have `ALLOW` and `DENY` rules  
  - Rules can **only** include IP Addresses  
  - Return traffic must be explicitly allowed by rules (stateless)  
  - Rules are evaluated in number order  

- **Security Groups**  
  - Are attached to the EC2 instances  
  - Controls traffic to and from an **ENI** (Elastic Network Interface) / EC2 Instance  
  - Can only have `ALLOW` rules  
  - Rules can include IP Addresses and other security groups  
  - Return traffic is automatically allowed regardless of any values (stateful)  
  - All rules are evaluated before deciding to allow traffic through  

### VPC Flow Logs  
- Capture information about IP traffic going into your interfaces  
  - `VPC` Flow logs  
  - `Subnet` Flow logs  
  - `Elastic Network Interface` Flow logs  
- Helps monitor & troubleshoot connectivity issues:  
  - subnet to internet  
  - subnet to subnet  
  - internet to subnet  
- Captures network information from AWS managed interfaces too: Elastic Load Balancers, Elasticache, RDS, Aurora etc  
- VPC Flow logs data can go to:  
  - S3  
  - CloudWatch Logs  
  - Kinesis Data Firehose

### VPC Peering  
- Connect two VPCs; privately using the AWS network  
- Make them behave as if they were in the same network  
- Must not have overlapping CIDR blocks  
- VPC Peering connection is **not transitive** (you need to connect each VPC that needs to communicate with one another)  

### VPC Endpoints  
- Endpoints allow you to connect to AWS Services **using a private network** instead of the public www network  
- Better security and lower latency to access AWS Services  
- You create a VPC Endpoint **Gateway** to allow connection S3 & DynamoDB only  
- The other VPC Endpoint that you can create is **Interface** which allows you to connect to the rest of the services  

### AWS PrivateLink (VPC Endpoint Services)  
- Generally used to connect to a 3rd party Vendor
- It is a way to expose a service to 1000s of VPCs  
- Does not require VPC peering, internet gateway, NAT, route tables  

3rd party VPC - Application Service <-> Network Load Balancer + AWS Private Link + Elastic Network Interface (ENI) <-> Consumer Application - Your VPC  

### Direct Connect & Site-to-Site VPN  
- `Site to Site VPN`  
  - Connect to an on-premises VPN to AWS  
  - The connection is automatically encrypted  
  - Goes over the **public Internet**  
  - On-prem must use a Customer Gateway (CGW)
  - AWS must use a Virtual Private Gateway (VGW)  
- `Direct Connect (DX)`  
  - Establish a physical connection between on-prem and AWS  
  - The connection is private, secure and fast  
  - Goes over a **private network**  
  - Takes at least a month to establish  
  - Faster and more reliable  

### Client VPN  
- Connect from your computer using OpenVPN to your private network in AWS and on-premises  
- Allow you to connect to your ECS instances over a private IP (just as if you were in the private VPC network)  
- Goes over the **public internet**  

### Transit Gateway  
- Having a transistive peering between thousands of VPC and on-prem, hub and spoke (star) connection  
- One Single Gateway to provide this functionality  
- Works with Direct Connect Gateway, VPN connection  

### VPC & Networking Summary  
`VPC`: Virtual Private Cloud  
`Subnets`: tied to an AZ, network partition of the VPC  
`Internet Gateway`: At the VPC level, provide internet access  
`NAT Gateway/Instances`: give internet access to private subnets, implement GW in the public subnet  
`NACL`: Stateless, subnet rules for inbound and outbound  
`Security Groups`: Stateful, operate at the EC2 instance level or ENI  
`VPC Peering`: Connect two VPC with non-overlapping IP ranges, non-transitive  
`Elastic IP`: Fixed public IPv4, ongoing cost if not in-use  
`VPC Endpoints`: Provide private access to AWS Services within the VPC  
`PrivateLink`: Privately connect to a service in a 3rd party VPC  
`VPC Flow Logs`: network traffic logs  
`Site to Site VPN`: VPN over public internet between on-premises DC and AWS  
`Client VPN`: OpenVPN connection from your computer into your VPC  
`Direct Connect`: Direct private physical connection to AWS  
`Transit Gateway`: Connect thousands of VPC and on-premises network together
