## Section 20 - Other Services    

`This section covers services that may appear on the exam...`  

### Amazon Workspaces  
- Managed Desktop as a Sertvice (DaaS) solution to easily **provision Windows or Linux desktops**  
- **Great to eliminate management of on-premise VDI (Virtual Desktop Infrastructure)**  
- Fast and quickly scalable to thousands of users  
- secured data - integrates with KMS  
- Pay-as-you-go service with monthly or hourly rates  
- Minimising latencies - deploy workspaces as close to users as possible  

### Amazon AppStream 2.0  
- Desktop Application streaming service  
- Deliver to any computer without acquiring or provisioning infrastructure  
- **The applicationis delivered from within a web browser**  

**Amazon Workspaces vs Amazon Appstream 2.0**  
- `Workspaces`:  
  - Fully managed VDI and desktop available  
  - The users connect to the VDI and open native or WAM applications  
  - The workspaces are on-demand or always on  
- `Appstream 2.0`  
  - Stream a specific desktop application to web browsers (no need to connect to a VDI)  
  - Works with any device (that has a web browser)  
  - Allowed to configure an instance type per application type (CPU, RAM, GPU)  

### AWS IoT Core Overview  
- IoT - Internet of Things - The network of internet-connected devices that are able to collect and transfer data  
- AWS IoT Core allows you to **easily connect IoT devices to the AWS Cloud**  
- **Serverless, secure & scalable** to billions of devices and trillions of messages  
- Your application can communicate with your devices even when they aren't connected  
- Integrates with a lot of AWS Services (Lambda, S3, SageMaker etc)  
- Build IoT application that gather, process, analyse and act on data  

### Amazon Elastic Transcoder  
- Elastic Transcoder is used to **convert media files stored in S3 into media files in the formats required by consumer playback devices (phones etc)**  
- Benfits:  
  - Easy to use  
  - Highly scalable - can handle large volumes of media files and large file sizes  
  - Cost Effective - duration based pricing model  
  - Fully managed & secure, pay for what you use pricing model  
  
What the flow looks like:   
`S3 Input Bucket -> Transcoding Pipeline -> S3 Output bucket -> Smartphones, tablets, PCs`  

### AWS AppSync

- Supports PITR (Point-in-time Recovery)  
- Retention Periods, Lifecycle Management, Backup Policies  
- Cross-Region Backup  
- Cross-Account Backup (using AWS Organisations)  

**Flow**: `Create a Backup Plan -> Select Service -> Backup pushed to S3`  

### Disaster Recovery Strategies  
- `Backup and Restore` (**Cheapest**)  
  - Backed up in the cloud  
  - Restored in another location
- `Pilot Light`  
  - Run core functions of the app  
  - Ready to scale but minimal setup  
- `Warm Standby`  
  - Full version of the app  
  - Minimum size but ready to scale  
- `Multi-site/Hot-site` (**Most Expensive**)  
  - Full version of the app  
  - Already scaled out at the full size  

### AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery (DRS)  
_formerly known as "CloudEndure Disaster Recovery"_  

- Quickly and easily **recover** your physical, virtual and cloud-based service **into** AWS  
- Example: protect your most critical databases (including Oracle, MySQL and SQL Server), enterprise apps (SAP), protect your data from ransomeware attacks etc  
- `Continuous block-level replication for your servers`  
- Note this is replication from a corporate DC or any cloud into AWS  
- The replication is done via a **AWS Replication Agent**  
- Replication is done to low cost EBS and EC2 instances, you then failover to a production ready system (in AWS) in minutes, then you can fallback when you are ready  

### AWS DataSync  
- `Move large amounts of data from on-prem to AWS`  
- Can synchronise to: Amazon S3 (any storage classes - including Glacier), Amazon EFS, Amazon FSx for Windows  
- Replication tasks can be scheduled by the hour, day or week  
- Replication is `incremental` after the first full replication    

### Application Discovery Service & Application Migration Service
