## Section 19 - Advanced Identity  

### Security Token Service (STS)  
<<<<<<< HEAD
- Create **temporary, limited privilege credentials** to access your AWS resources  
- Short-term credentials; you configure expiration period  
- Use cases:  
  - **Identity federation**: manage user identities in external systems and provide them with STS tokens to access AWS resources  
  - **IAM Roles for cross/same account access**  
  - **IAM Roles for Amazon EC2**: provide temporary credentials for EC2 instances to access AWS resources  

### Cognito  
- Provide Identity _for you Web and Mobile applications users_ (potentially millions)  
- Instead of creating them an IAM user, you create a user in Cognito  
- This is for external user access to system resource like users on facebook, zwift etc  

### AWS Directory Services  
This is an extension of Microsoft Active Directory:  
  - Database of objects; users, printers, file shares, security groups etc  
  - Centralised security management, create and assign accounts  

- **AWS Directory Services (trust)**  
  - Create your own AD in AWS, manage users locally, supports MFA  
  - Establish "trust" connections with your on-prem AD  
- **AD Connector (proxy)**  
  - Directory Gateway (proxy) to redirect to on-prem AD, supports MFA  
  - USers are managed on the on-prem AD  
- **Simple AD (stand-alone)**  
  - AD-compatible managed directory on AWS  
  - Cannot be joined with on-prem AD  

### AWS IAM Identity Center  
- This is the (successor to AWS Single Sign-On)  

One login for all your:    
  - **AWS accounts in AWS Organisations**  
  - business cloud applications (eg, Salesforce, Box, Microsft 365, ...)  
  - SAML2.0 enabled applications  
  - EC2 Windows Instances  

- Identity providers:  
  - Built-in identity store in IAM identity Center  
  - 3rd Party: Active Directory (AD), OneLogin, Okta  

- There is a single centralised portal (**AWS IAM Identity Center Portal**) that you use instead of remembers a bunch of account names/passwords for different AWS Organisations and Accounts
