## Section 6 - EC2 Storage    
 
### EBS Overview  
- An EBS (Elastic Block Storage) Volume is a network drive you can attach to your instances  
- It allows your EC2 instance to persist data, even after their termination  
- For the CCP level, one EBS volume can only be mounted to one EC2 instance (AS, Dev or SysOps Level, goes into multi-attach)  
- EBS Volumes are bound to a specific availability zone  
- Free tier; 30GB/month of General Purpose SSD (or magnetic storage)  

### EBS Volume  
- **First and foremost, it is a network drive**  
  - It uses the network to communicate with the instance, therefore there may be some latency  
  - It can be detached from an EC2 instance and attached to another one quickly  
- It is locked to an AZ  
  - It cannot be moved from us-east-1a to us-east-1b  
  - To move the volume you would need to snapshot it  
- You have to provision capacity in adavance (as well as IOPS)  
- You can create an unattached volume  
- EBS has an attribute - `Delete on Termination`; This is selected for the root volume and not additional EBS volumes
  - To change this setting, you need to do it through the CLI, there is no way to do it in the console  
    - Windows  
    ```
    aws ec2 modify-instance-attribute `
    --instance-id i-a1b2c3d4e5f6g7 `
    --region us-east-1 `
    --block-device-mappings '[{"DeviceName": "/dev/sdf","Ebs": {"DeleteOnTermination":true}}]'
    ```
    - Linux  
    ```
    aws ec2 modify-instance-attribute \
    --instance-id i-1234567890abcdef0 \
    --region us-east-1 \
    --block-device-mappings "[{\"DeviceName\": \"/dev/sda1\",\"Ebs\":{\"DeleteOnTermination\":false}}]"
    ```
  - You can control this setting by the AWS console or through the AWS CLI  
  - Use case: Preserve root volume when the instance in terminated  

**Note about EBS Multi-Attach, it is possible with io1 and io2 volumes**  

### Creating an EBS Volume  
Go to `EC2` -> `Elastic Block Storage` -> `Volumes` -> `Create Volume`  

### EBS Snapshots  
- These are basically backups of the EBS Volume at any point in time  
- You don't have to detach the volume but is recommended  
- You can copy snapshots across an AZ or a region    

**EBS Snapshot Features**  
- EBS Snapshot Archive  
  - Move snapshot to an `archive tier` that is 75% cheaper  
  - BUT it takes between 24 - 72 hours to restore from the archive  
- Recycle Bin for EBS Snapshots  
  - Set up rules for retention and deletion of the snapshots  
  - retention period is `1 day to 1 year`  

- Create a snapshot  
  - Navigate to the volume property page then click `Actions` -> `Create snapshot`  
  - Add a description and tags  

- Create a volume from a snapshot (in any AZ)  
  - Select the snapshot then go to `Actions` -> `Create Volume from Snapshot`  
  - Select the size, **select the AZ**, create tags and select whether you want it encrypted or not.  

- Copy Snapshot to a new Region  
  - Navigate to the Snapshots page, you can right click and copy snapshot or go to `Actions` -> `Copy snapshot`  
  - Select any destination region that you want!  

- Copy a volume from one AZ to another  
  - Create a snapshot of the volume (snapshots are region specific)  
  - Copy the snapshot to another region  
  - Create a volume from the snapshot, while you are creating the volume, you get to choose your AZ! 

- Archive Snapshot  
  - Go to the snapshot, click on the `Storage Tier` tab  
  - You can see the storage tier here - `standard`  
  - You can select `Actions` -> `Archive Snapshot` to move to a lower storage tier  
    - Note: it can take between 24 to 72 hours to have the snapshot restored  

- Recycle Bin  
  - You can look through the recycle bin via the `Snapshots` page  
  - It contains deleted snapshots and deleted AMIs  
  - You can create a retention rule  
  - You can select whether it applies to resources with specific tags  
  - Retention is from 1 to 365 days  
  - You can also lock the rule or leave it unlocked  

### AMI Overview  
- AMI: Amazon Machine Image  
- An AMI is a customisation of an EC2 instance  
  - You add software, configurations, OS, etc  
  - An AMI allows faster boot and configuration time because all the software is pre-packaged  
- **AMI are region specific**  
  - they can be copied across regions and shared between accounts  
- You can launch EC2 instances from:  
  - `A Public AMI` - AWS Provided  
  - `A Private AMI` - that you manage  
  - `An AWS Marketplace AMI` - an AMI that someone else has made/maintains and possibily sells  

### AMI Process  
- Start an EC2 instance and customise it via User Data or whatever other method you use    
- Stop the instance  
- Build an AMI - this will also create an EBS snapshot  
  - Select the instance -> `Actions` -> `Image and Templates` -> `Create image`  
  - Add an image name and a description  
  - To check the status, it is in the `Images` page and then look at AMIs  
- Launch an instance with the new AMI!  
- **NOTE: AMIs are region specific!**  
- To delete an AMI, you need to `De-register` it from the `Actions` menu  


### EC2 Image Builder  
- It is used to `automate` the creation of **virtual machines** or **container images**  
- `EXAM TIP` Automate the creation, maintain, validate and test EC2 AMIs  
- It can be run on a schedule (weekly, whenever a package is updated etc)  
- Free service (only pay for the underlying resources)  

**How the service works**  
- There is an EC2 Image Builder Service  
- A `Builder EC2 Instance` is created  
  - On which:  
    - Build components are applied (customised OS)  
- An AMI is then created from this builder instance  
- A Test EC2 instance is spun up and a test suite (that you define is run against it)  
- AMI is distributed (can be multiple regions)

### EC2 Instance Store  
- EBS are `network drives` with good but **limited** performance  
- If you need a **high-performance** hardware disk, use an EC2 Instance Store  
- EC2 Instance stores:  
  - have better I/O performance  
  - lose their storage if stopped (they are ephemeral)  
  - good for buffering / caching / scratch data / temporary content  
  - There is a risk of data loss if the hardware fails  
  - Backups and Replication is the customers responsibility  
  - Extremely high IOPS...over 1 million compared to 32,000 for EBS
  - `EXAM TIP` If you see very high performance hardware attached volume, think EC2 Instance store!  

### EFS Overview  
- Elastic File System  
- Managed NFS (Network File System) that can be mounted to 100s of EC2 instances  
- EFS works only with linux EC2 instances and works in multiple AZs  
- Highly available, scalable **expensive** (approximately 3x as much as gp2), pay per use, no capacity planning is required (pay for what you use only)  

**Differences**
`EXAM TIP`  
```
EBS is only attached to one instance in one AZ  
Need to create a snapshot, then create a new volume in the new zone  
This is only a copy and not synced  

EFS is shared with whichever instance is mounted to it  
```

**EFS-IA**  
EFS Infrequent Access  
- It is a storage class that is cost-optimised for files that are not accessed frequently  
- About 92% cheaper than standard EFS  
- EFS will auto-move files to EFS-IA based on the last time they were accessed  
- Enable EFS-IA with a lifecycle policy  
  - eg, moved files not accessed in 60 days  
  - This is transparent to the application using EFS  

### Shared Responsibility Model  
**AWS**  
- Infra  
- replication for data for EBS and EFS volumes  
- replacing faulty hardware  
- ensuring their employees can't access your data  
**Customer**  
- setting up backups/snapshots  
- setting up data encryption  
- responsible for any data on the drives  
- understanding the risk of using EC2 instance store
