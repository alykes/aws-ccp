## Section 9 - Databases and Analytics  

### Introduction  
Storing data on disk via traditional methods (EFS, EBS, EC2 Instance Store, S3) can have limits  
Some use cases make so that you a DB is the perfect use case to house this data  
The data can be structured  
You then build indexes to efficiently search through the data  
You can also define relationships between datasets  

Databases are optimised for a purpose and come with different features

### Relational Databases
Used for structured data  
Data is arranged in rows, columns and tables  
Data can be linked via relationships between tables  
SQL is used to interrogate the data  

### NoSQL Databases  
NoSQL = non-SQL = non relational databases  
NoSQL databases are purpose built for specific data models and have flexible schemas for building modern applications  
Benefits:  
  - **Flexibility**: Easy to evolve data models  
  - **Scalability**: designed to scale-out by using distributed clusters  
  - **High Performance**: optimised for specific data models  
  - **Highly functional**: types optimed for data models  
Examples: Key-Value, documents, graphs, in-memory, search databases  



**JSON Example**  
```
{
    "name": "Ango",
    "age": "30",
    "cars": [
        "BMW",
        "Holden",
        "Ferrari",
    ],
    "address": {
        "type": "house",
        "number": "42",
        "street": "Star Breeze Street"
    }
}
```
JSON -> **J**ava**S**cript **O**bject **N**otation  
JSON is a common form of data that fits into a NoSQL model  
Data can be nested, as in the example  
Fields can change over time  
There is support for new types such as arrays  

### Databases and Shared Responsibility on AWS  
- AWS offers use to manage different databases  
- Benefits include:  
  - Quick provisioning, High Availability, Vertical and Horizontal Scaling  
  - Automated Backup and Restore, Operations and Upgrades  
  - Operating System Patching is handled by AWS  
  - Monitoring and alerting  

**Note:** databases can be run on EC2 instances but you have to handle everything, such as resiliency, backup, patching, high availability, fault tolerance, scaling etc  

### AWS RDS Overview  
- **RDS** - Relational Database Service  
- Managed DB service
- Uses SQL as a query language  
- AWS databases are managed by AWS and can be the following flavours:  
  - Postgres  
  - MySQL  
  - MariaDB  
  - Oracle  
  - Microsoft SQL Server  
  - Aurora (AWS Proprietary database)

**Advantages to use RDS over in-house DB on EC2**  
- Automated provisioning, OS patching  
- continuous backups and restore to specific timestamps (Point in Time Restores)  
- Monitoring dashboard  
- read replicas for improved read performance  
- Multi AZ setup for DR  
- maintenance windows for upgrades  
- ability to scale (vertically or horizontally)  
- storage backed by EBS (gp2 or io1)
`Exam Tip` **NOTE**: You cannot ssh into an RDS instance!  

**RDS Solution Architecture**  
Elastic Load Balancer  -> EC2 instances (possibly ASG) -> RDS
Web requests -> Application Logic -> Read and Writes of Data  

### Amazon Aurora  
- Aurora is an AWS proprietary database from AWS and is notopen source  
- **PostgreSQL** and **MySQL** are supported as Aurora DB  
- Aurora is AWS Cloud optimised and claims **5x** performance imnprovement over **MySQL** on RDS and over **3x** the performance of **Postgres** on RDS.  
- Aurora sotrage automatically grows in __increments of 10GB__, up to a **max of 128TB**  
- Aurora is about 20% more expensive than RDS but is more efficient  
- Aurora is **NOT** included in the free tier  

### Creating RDS and RDS Snapshots  
- **Deploying RDS**  
    - You have an option of a **standard** create or an **easy** create (easy create using the standard best practises)  
    - Templates are Prod, Dev/Test and Free (settings change based on what you select, eg AZ count)  
    - The instance types for the free tier are `db.t2.micro`, `db.t3.micro`and `db.t4g.micro`  
    - You can set up public access and then create a security group for it  
    - Free tier 20GB General Purpose Storage SSD  
    - 20GB automated back up storage and user-initiated DB Snapshots
- **Snapshots**  
    - You can also `share` the snapshot cross-account  
    - An RDS snapshot can also be used to `migrate` to a new database engine!  
    - You can `export` the snapshot to S3  
    - Use `restore` to restore into the same region  
    - Use `copy` to move the DB between regions

### RED Deployment Options: Read Replicas, Multi-AZ  
- **Read Replicas**:  
  - Scale the read workload of your DB  
  - Can create up to 15 Read Replicas  
  - Data is only written to the main DB  
- **Multi-AZ**:  
  - In the case of an AZ failure  
  - Gives you high availability  
  - Failover DB in another AZ  
  - The failover DB is passive  
  - Can only nominate one other AZ as a failover  
- **Multi-Region (Read Replica)**  
  - Same as the Read Replicas but it is across regions  
  - DR in case of a regional issue  
  - Better for local performance  
  - Replication cost as data cost is associated with data transfer across regions   

### Amazon Elasticache  
- ElastiCache is used to instantiate a **Redis** or **memcached** database 
- These are `in-memory` with `high performance` and `low latency`  
- Helps reduce load off the database for read intensive workloads  
- AWS takes care of OS, patching, maintenance, optimisation, configuration, monitoring, failover, backups etc  
- Fully managed service  

Solution Architecture is similar to RDS but it will push some stuff into the Elasticache to offload some of the workload  

### Amazon DynamoDB  
- Fully managed Highly Available with replication across 3 AZs  
- NoSQL database  
- Scales to massive workloads, distributes `serverless` database  
- millions of requests per second, trillions of rows, 100s of TB storage  
- fast and consistent in performance  
- `single digit millisecond latency` - low latency retreival  
- integrated with IAM for security, authorisation and administration  
- low cost and auto-scaling capabilities  
- standard and Infrequent Access (IA) Table classes for cost savings  

**What types of data are suitable for DynamoDB?**  
- It is a key value database  
- Primary Key consists of `partition key` and a `sort key`  
- The values associated with the keys areknown as `attribute`  

**DynamoDB Accelerator - DAX**  
- Fully managed in-memory cache exclusively for DynamoDB  
- 10x performance improvement, therefore goes from ms to Î¼s latency  
- Secure, highly scalable and highly available  
- **Difference** is that DAX is **ONLY** used for DynamoDB and elasticache is used for other databases  

### DynamoDB - Global Tables  
- Make a DynamoDB table accessible with low latency in `multiple regions`  
- You can set up two way replication  
- It is an **ACTIVE/ACTIVE** replication as you can read/write into multiple regions at the same time  

### RedShift Overview  
- based on PostgreSQL, but it's not used for OLTP (OnLine Transaction Processing) like RDS  
- It's OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) and is used for analytics and data warehousing  
- `Exam Tip` - If a questions asks if your database needs to do analytics and be a data warehouse, then **REDSHIFT** will be the answer.  
- Load data once every hour, not every second  
- 10x better performance than other data warehouses, scales to PB of data  
- It is a **columnar** database, instead of the normal row based DBs  
- It uses MPP (Massively Parallel Query Execution) and is highly available  
- Pay as you go based on the instances provisioned  
- Has an SQL interface for performing queries  
- Integrates with BI tools such as AWS Quicksight or Tableau  

### EMR - Elastic MapReduce  
`Exam Tip` - Whenever a **hadoop cluster** is mentioned, think Amazon EMR  
- Used to create a hadoop cluster (Big Data) to analyse and process vast amounts of data  
- The clusters can be made of hundreds of EC2 instances  
- Supports Apache Spark, HBase, Presto, Flink  
- EMR takes care of all the provisioning and configuration  
- Auto-scales and integrated with spot instances  
- Use Cases:  
  - data processings, machine learning, web indexing, big data!  

### Athena Overview  
- **Serverless** query service to **perform analytics against S3 objects**  
- Uses standard SQL to query files  
- Supports CSV, JSON, ORRC, Avro and Parquet(built on Presto)  
- Customer loads data into S3, Athena Queries and analyses the data, then Amazon Quicksight can do the presentation of reporting and dashboards  
- $5 per TB of data scanned  
- Use compressed or columnar data for cost-savings because there is less to scan
- Use Cases:  
  - BI  
  - Analytics  
  - Reporting  
  - Analysis  
  - query VPC flow logs, ELB logs, CloudTrail trails etc 
`Exam Tip` - whenever you see analyse data in S3 using serverless SQL, think Amazon Athena

### Amazon Quicksight  
- Serverless machine learning powered business intelligence services to create interactive dashboards  
- The go to tool for BI in AWS  
- Fast, automatically scalable, it can be embedded, with per-session pricing  
- Use Cases:  
  - Business Analytics  
  - Building visualisations  
  - Perform ad-hoc analysis  
  - Get business insights using data  
- Integrated with a bunch of services such as RDS, Aurora, Athena, Redshift, S3 etc...  

### Amazon DocumentDB  
- is an AWS proprietary technology to implement **MongoDB** (NoSQL database)  
- MongoDB is used to store, query and index JSON data  
- Similar to the deployments concepts of Aurora  
- Fully managed, highly available with replication across 3 AZs  
- DocumentDB storage automatically grows in increments of 10GB up to 64TB  
- Automatically scales to workloads with millions of requests per second  

### Amazon Neptune  
- Fully managed **graph** database  
- Popular **graph dataset** would be a social network  
  - Users have friends  
  - Posts have comments  
  - Comments have likes from users  
  - Users share and like posts  
- Highly available across 3 AZs, with up to 15 replicas  
- Build and run applications working with highly connected datasets - optimised for complex queries  
- Can store up to billions of relations and query the graph with only ms latency  
- Great for knowledge graphs such as wikipedia, fraud detections, recommendation engines, social networking  

### Amazon QLDB  
- Quantum Ledger DataBase  
- A ledger is a book for recording **financial transactions**  
- Fully managed, serverless, HA, replicationa across 3 AZs  
- Used to review history of all the changes made to your application data over time  
- Immutable system: no entry can be removed or modified  
- It is cryptographically verifiable, using a journally system    
- 2-3x better performance than common ledger blockchain frameworks  
- you can manipulate data using SQL  
- Difference with Amazon Managed Blockchain: **no decentralisation component**, in accordance with financial regulations, central authority   

### Amazon Managed Blockchain  
- Blockchain makes it possible to build applciations where multiple parties can execute transactions **without the need for a trusts, central authority**    
- Amazon Managed Blockchain is a managed service that can:  
  - Join blockchain networks  
  - Create your own scalable private network  
- Currently only compatible with the following:  
  - Hyperledger Fabric  
  - Ethereum
- `Exam Tip` For the exam, if you hear decentralised, hyperledger fabric or ethereum, this Amazon Managed Blockchain  

## Amazon Glue  
- `Exam Tip` Glue is an ETL - extract, transform and load service. This is all you need to know for the exam.  
- managed extract, transform and load (ETL) service  
- useful to prepare and transform data for analytics  
- fully serverless service  
- Glue Data Catalog: catalog of your datasets  

### Amazon DMS
