## Section 17 - Machine Learning  

### Rekognition  
This service is used to find the following items in images and videos:  
  - objects  
  - people  
  - text  
  - scenes
- Facial analysis and facial search can be used to perform user verification and people counting  
- Create a database of familiar faces or compare them against celebrities  
- Use cases:  
  - labeling  
  - content moderation  
  - text detection  
  - face detection and analysis (gender, age range, emotions etc)  
  - Face Search and Verification  
  - Celebrity Recognition  
  - Pathing, which is used for things like sports game analysis  

### Transcribe  
- Automatically converts speech to text  
- uses **deep learning** process called **automatic speech recognition (ASR)** to convert speech to text quickly and accurately  
- **Austomatically removes PII using redaction**  
- supports **Automatic Language Identification for multi-lingual audio**  
- Use cases:  
  - transcibe customer service calls  
  - automate closed captioning and subtitling  
  - generate metadata for media assets to create fully searchable content  

### Polly  
- This is the opposite of Transcribe  
- Turn Text into Speech  
- Allows you to create applications that talk  

### Translate  
- Natural and accurate **language translation**  
- Amazon Translate allows you to **localise content** - such as websites and applications - for **international users**  
- Allows you to translate large volumes of text efficiently  

### Amazon Lex & Connect  
- `Amazon Lex` is the same technology that powers Amazon Alexa  
  - Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) to convert speech to text  
  - Natural Language Understanding to recognise the intent of text or speech (callers)  
  - Help build chatbots, or call center bots  
- `Amazon Connect`  
  - **Receive calls**, create contact flows, cloud based **virtual contact center**  
  - Can integrate with other CRM systems or AWS  
  - No upfront payment and it is cheaper than 80% of traditional contact center colutions  

### Comprehend  
- `Exam Tip`: Used for **Natural Language Processing** - `NLP`  
- Fully managed and serverless service  
- Uses machine learning to find insights and relationships in text
  - Language of the text  
  - Extract key phrases, places, people, brands or events  
  - Understands how positive or negative the text is  
  - Analyses text using tokenisation and parts of speech  
  - Automatically organises a collection of text files by topic  
- Use Cases:  
  - Analyse customer interactions (emails) to find what leads to positive or negative experience  
  - Create and group articales by topic that Comprehend uncovers  

### Sagemaker  
- It is a fully managed service for developers/data scientists **to build their own ML models**  
- Typically difficult to do all the processes in one place and provision servers  
- Machine Learning prociess (simplified): predicting your exam score  
  - Grab Historical Data + metadata  
  - Label the data  
  - Get scores  
  - Build the ML model  
  - Train and Tune the model  
  - Deploy and apply the model to new data to predict the score  

### Forecast  
- Fully managed service that uses ML to deliver highly accurate forecasts  
- Example: predict the future sales of an item  
- 50% more accurate than looking at the data itself  
- Reduce forecasting time from months to hours  
- Use cases:  
  - Product Demand Planning  
  - Financial Planning  
  - Resource Planning  
How:  
  - Get historical data  
  - Upload to S3  
  - Run Amazon Forecast on the dataset  
  - Forecasting model is creating  
  - You can than get your forecast 

### Kendra  
- Fully managed **document search service** powered by ML  
- Extracts answers from within a document  
- Kendra Indexes the documents  
- It has Natural Language search capabilities  
- Learns from user interactions/feedback to promote the preferred results (**Incremental Learning**)  
- Ability to manually fine-tune search results by importance of data, freshness or a custom setting  

### Personalise  
- Fully managed ML service to build apps with real-time personalised recommendations  
- An example use case would be to personalise product recommendations/re-ranking, customised direct marketing  
  - Say a user bought a tool for repairing their car, personalise will recommend a product to buy next    
- Same technology that is used on amazon.com  
- integrates into existing websites, applications, SMS, email marketing systems etc  
- Implement in days, not months (you don't need to build, train or deploy an ML solution)  
- Use cases:  
  - Retail stores  
  - Media outlets  
  - Entertainment suppliers  

### Textract  
Used to extract text from scanned images using AI and ML  
- Extract data from forms and tables  
- Read and process any type of document  
- Use cases:  
  - Public Sector (tazx forms, ID documents, passports)  
  - Healthcare (medical records, insurance claims)  
  - Financial Services (invoices, financial reports)
