## Section 10 - Other Compute Services: ECS, Lambda, Batch, LightSail  

### Docker  
- Package apps into a container  
- Apps run the same way, regardless where they run  
- Consistent performance  
- Scales up and down very easily  
- Images can be stored in Docker Repositories https://hub.docker.com  
- You can also use ECR (Private Repository)  
- Many containers on one server  

### Amazon ECS  
- `Elastic Container Service`  
- Used to launch docker containers on AWS  
- **You must provision and maintain the infrastructure (the EC2 instances) or you can use Fargate**  
- AWS takes care of starting / stopping containers  
- Has integration with an Application Load Balancer  
- There is an ECS Service running on the EC2 instance  

### Amazon Fargate  
- Launch Docker containers on AWS  
- **You do not provision the infrastructure (no EC2 instances to manage)**  
- Fully serverless offering  
- AWS just runs the container for you based on the CPU/RAM required  
- completely abstracted  

### Amazon ECR  
- `Elastic Container Registry`  
- It is an AWS docker registry    
- This is where you store your docker images so that can be run by ECS or fargate  
- The registries can either be private or public  

### Serverless Introduction  
- It is a paradigm in which developers don't have to manage servers anymore  
- Devs simply deploy code, generally as functions  
- Initially, Serverless was FaaS (Funcation as a Service)  
- Serverless was pioneered by AWS lambda but now also includes anything that is managed; DBs, messaging, storage etc  
- Serverless does not mean there are no servers, it just means you don't need to manage or provision them.  
**Amazon S3 is a serverless service, so is DynamoDB, and so to is Fargate and lambda**  

### Amazon Lambda  
Why use Lambda?  
- Traditionally: 
  - Servers are limited by RAM and CPU.  
  - They need to be continuously running.  
  - Scaling would mean that you need to intervene to add/remove servers.  
- With lambda:  
  - All you have to do is write virtual functions - there are no servers to manage  
  - The executions of the function are short and limited by time  
  - They can be run on-demand  
  - Scaling is automated  

**Benefits of AWS Lambda**  
- Easy Pricing:  
   - Pay per request and compute time  
   - Free tier 1 million AWS lambda requests and 4000,000GB seconds of compute time  
- Integrated with the whole AWS suite of services  
- **Event-Driven**: Function get invoked by AWS when an event happens or when it's needed (reactive)  
- Integrated with many programming languages  
- Easy monitoring through AWS CloudWatch  
- Easy to get more resources per function (up to 10GB RAM)  
- Increasing RAM will also improve CPU and network.  

AWS Lambda language support:  
- node.js (javascript)  
- python  
- java (java 8 compatible)  
- C# (.net core)  
- golang  
- C# / Powershell  
- Ruby  
- Custom Runtime API (community supported, example Rust)  

You can also run lambda container images:  
  - The container image must have the lambda runtime api implemented  
  - ECS/Fargate is the preferred method for running arbitary docker images  

**It's good to implement serverless CRON jobs**  
You can use Clooudwatch Events or EventBridge to trigger a lambda function every hour etc  

Pricing:  
  - https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/pricing  
  - **Pay per call**:  
    - first 1 million are free  
    - $0.20 per 1 million requests thereafter  
  - **Pay per duration**:  
    - in 1 ms increments  
    - 400,000GB-seconds of compute time per month is free  
    - == 400,000 seconds if function is 1GB RAM  
    - == 3,200,000 seconds if function is 128MB RAM  
    - thereafter $1.00 for 600,000 GB-seconds  
  - It is usually very cheap to run AWS lambda so it's very popular  

`Exam Tip` - Just remember that lambda pricing is based on **calls** and **duration**  

**Hands On**  
When creating lambda functions, you get four options to choose from:  
  - Author from scratch  
  - Use a blueprint  
  - Use a lambda container  
  - Browse the marketplace for templates  

### Amazon API Gateway  
It is used to create a serverless API for a lambda function  
Client --Restful_API--> API Gateway --Proxy_Request--> Lambda --C.R.U.D.--> DynamoDB  

- It is a fully managed service for developers to easily create, publish, maintain, monitor and secure APIs  
- It is serverless and fully scalaable  
- Supports RESTful APIs and WebSocket APIs  
- Support for security, user authentication, API throttling, API keys, monitoring etc  

### AWS Batch  
- It is fully managed batch processing at any scale  
- Efficiently run 100,000s of computing batch jobs on AWS  
- A batch job is a job with a start and an end  
- batch will dynamically launch EC2 instances/Spot instances  
- AWS Batch provisions the right amount of compute and memory  
- You submit or schedule batch jobs and AWS Batch does the rest  
- Batch jobs are defined as **Docker Images** and run on **ECS**  
- Helpful for cost optimisation and focusing less on infrastructure   

**What is the difference between Batch vs Lambda?**  
- `Lambda`:  
  - Time limited (max 15 minutes)  
  - Limited runtimes  
  - Limited temporary disk space  
  - Serverless  
- `Batch`:  
  - No time limit  
  - Can use any runtime as long as it's packaged as a docker image  
  - Relies on EBS/instance store for disk space  
  - Relies on EC2 (can be managed by AWS)  

### LightSail  
- It provides virtual servers, storage, databases and networking  
- low and predictable pricing  
- simpler alternative to using EC2, RDS, ELB, EBS, Route 53 etc  
- Great for people with little cloud experience  
- Can set up notifications and monitoring of your lightsail resources  
- Use cases:  
  - simple web apps (it provides templates for LAMP stacks, nginx, MEAN, node.js etc)  
  - websites (has templates for wordpress, magento, plesk, joomla)  
  - Dev/Test environment  
- Has HA but no auto-scaling, very limited AWS integration  

### Summary  
- `Docker`: container technology to run applications  
- `ECS`: run docker containers on EC2 instances  
- `Fargate`:  
  - Run docker containers without provisioning the infrastructure  
  - serverless offering  
- `ECR`: Private Docker Images Repository  
- `Batch`: run batch jobs on AWS across managed EC2 instances  
- `Lightsail`: Predictable & low-cost for simple application stacks  

### Lambda Summary  
- Lambda is serverless, aka Function as a Service, seamless scaling, fully reactive  
- **Lambda billing**:  
  - by **run time x the RAM** provisioned  
  - by the **number of invocations**  
- **Language support**: many different languages except (arbitary) Docker  
- **Invocation time**: up to 15 minutes  
- **Use Cases**:  
  - Create thumbnails for images uploaded to S3  
  - Run serverless cron job  
- **API Gateway**: exposes lambda functions as HTTP API
