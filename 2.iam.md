## Section 4 - IAM  

**Identity & Access Management -> Global Service**  

Root account is created by default, it shouldn't be used or shared. (Create additional accounts for AWS).   
Users are people in the org and can be grouped.  
Users do not need to belong to a group, this is not generally considered best practise.  
Users can also belong to multiple groups.  

Groups can only contain users and **NOT** other groups  

### IAM Permissions  
Users or Groups can be assigned JSON documents called policies. (effect, action, resource)  
Policies define user permissions.  
Best practise to apply **least privilege principle**.  

**You can create an account alias to replace the 12 number account ID**  

### IAM Policy Inheritance  
Group level attachment, all users in group get them.  
An **inline** policy is when a policy is attached directly to a user!  

### IAM Policy Structure  
Consists of:  
  - **Version** the language or version to be used eg `2012-10-17`.    
  - **ID** an identifier for the policy. (OPTIONAL)  
  - **statements** one or more individual statements, this is a required field.  

A `statment` consists of:  
  - **sid** the statement id (OPTIONAL)  
  - **Effect** whether the statement will be `Allow` or `Deny`  
  - **Principal** the account/user/role to which this policy will apply  
  - **Action** the actions this policy __allows__ or __denies__  
  - **Resource** the list of resources to which the actions applies to  
  - **Condition** conditions for when this policy is in effect (OPTIONAL)  

```
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Id": "S3-Account-Permissions",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid":"1",
      "Effect":"Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS":["arn:aws:iam::123456789012:root"],
      },
      "Action": [
        "s3:GetObject",
        "s3:PutObject"
      ],
      "Resource":["arn:aws:s3:::mybucket/*"]
    }
  ]
}
```  

### Creating IAM Policies  
Two ways to do this:  
  - Visual Editor, which is a point and click wizard. Selecting `Service`, `Actions`, `Resources` and `Request Conditions`.     
  - Write JSON directly.  

### IAM - Password Policy  
You can set up a custom password policy in AWS or use a default one  
The settings are in **IAM -> Access Management -> Account Settings**  

Password policy customisable configurations are:  
  - Minimum password length  
  
  - Password Strength: 
    - uppercase/lowercase  
    - numbers  
    - non-alphanumberic characters  
  - Other Requirements:  
    - Allow IAM users to change their own passwords  
    - Password expiry  
    - Password expiry requires admin reset  
    - Prevent password reuse  

### MFA Overview  
Multi-Factor Authentication  
You should protect your Root Account and IAM users  
MFA => password __you know__ and device that __you own__  
**Benefit:** If the password is stolen or hacked, the account will not be compromised without the **device** for the MFA password.  

**MFA device Options in AWS**  
Virtual MFA device  
- Google Authenticator  
- Authy  
  - Support for multiple tokens on a single device

U2F - Universal 2nd Factor Security Key  
- Yubikey by Yubico (3rd Party)  
  - Provides support for multiple root and IAM users using a single security key.  

Hardware Key Fob MFA Device  
- Provided by **Gemalto** (3rd Party)  

Hardware Key Fob MFA Device for AWS GovCloud (US)  
- Provided by **SurePassID** (3rd Party)  

**Setting up MFA for the root user**    
You need to log in as root  
Click your user name and then select `Security Credentials`  
Click `Assign MFA Device`  
Select the MFA Device (you can have a max of 8):  
  - Authenticator App -> There will be a link for compatible software on Android or iOS    
    - Twilio Authy Authenticator, Duo Mobile, LastPass Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator, Google Authenticator, Symantec VIP  
  - Security Key  
  - Hardware TOTP token  

### AWS Access Keys, CLI and SDK  
To access AWS, you have 3 options  
  - AWS Management Console (password + MFA)  
  - AWS Command Line Interface (Access Keys)  
  - AWS Software Developer Kit (Access Keys)  

Generate Access Keys through the console or CLI.  
Users manage their own access keys.  
Treat Access Keys just like a password and do not share them.  
They come as a pair, `Access Key ID` and `Access Key Secret`  

### AWS CLI  
- CLI tool to interact with AWS services using the command line shell  
- Direct access to the public API of AWS Services  
- You can develp scripts to manage resources  
- it's open source https://github.com/aws/aws-cli  
- It's an alternative to using the web console

### AWS SDK  
- Langauge specific APIs (set of libraries)  
- Enables you to access and manage AWS Services programmatically  
- Embedded within your application  
- Supports: 
  - SDKs in JS, Python, PHP, .net, ruby, java, go, node.js, c++  
  - Mobile SDKs (Android, iOS, ...)  
  - IoT Device SDKs (Embedded C, Arduino, ...)  
- The AWS CLI is built on `AWS SDK for Python`  

### Cloudshell  
It isn't available in all regions, make sure to check where it is available in the AWS documentation  
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudshell/latest/userguide/supported-aws-regions.html  

The credentials used are the ones that you log into the console with.  
It will use the region that you have in the upper right context as the default region when performing actions.  
All files in the cloudshell environment are persistent.  

You can upload and download files.  
Set options for the cloudshell itself, like font size, theme and safe paste (multi-line pasting confirmation)  
You can split the console into rows, columns, tabs.  
The home directory is `/home/cloudshell-user`  

### IAM Roles for Services  
Some AWS Services can perform actions on your behalf  
You will need to assign `permissions` to `AWS Services` with **IAM Roles**  

When you create a Role for an EC2 instance, it will be referred to as an `entity`  

**Common Roles** include:  
- EC2 Instance Roles  
- Lambda Function Roles  
- Roles for CloudFormation  

Roles allow entities to retrieve credentials from AWS to be used for a short duration.  
You can create a role for the following trusted entity types:  
- AWS Service (**This is the only one in the exam**)  
- AWS Account  
- Web Identity  
- SAML 2.0 Federation  
- Custom Trust Policy  

Most common use case for AWS Service Role is for `EC2` or `lambda`  

The Steps are:  
- Select the Entity  
- Add a permission  
- Name, review and Create  

### IAM Security Tools  
- `IAM Credentials Report` **(Account Level)**  
  - Report lists all the accounts's users and status of their various credentials.  
  - Accessed through `IAM` --> `Access Reports` --> `Credential Report`  
    - Downloads a .csv file

- `IAM Access Advisor` **(User Level)**  
  - Shows service permissions granted to a user and when those services were last accessed.  
  - Accessed through IAM --> `Users` --> select the user --> `Access Advisor Tab`  

**Use these tools to revise your policies.**  

### IAM Best Practise  

- **NEVER** use the root account except when setting up AWS  
- One Physical user = One AWS User  
- **Assign users to groups** and **assign permissions to groups**  
- Create a **strong password policy**  
- Enforce MFA  
- Create and use **Roles** for giving permissions to **AWS Services**  
- Use Access Keys for Programmatice Access  
- Audit permissions of your account using IAM Credentials Report or IAM Access Advisor  
- Never share IAM users or Access Keys  

### Shared for Responsibility Model for IAM  
- AWS:  
  - Infra (global and network security)  
  - Config and vuln analysis  
  - compliance validation  

- You:  
  - Users, Groups, Policies management and monitoring  
  - Enable MFA on all accounts  
  - Rotate your keys often  
  - Use IAM tools to apply appropriate permissions  
  - Analyse access patterns & review permissions  

### IAM Summary  
`Users`: mapped to a physical user, has a password for the AWS Console.  
`Groups`: contains only users  
`Policies`: JSON document that outlines permissions for users and groups  
`Roles`: for EC2 instances or AWS Services  
`Security`: MFA + Password Policy  
`AWS CLI`: Manage your AWS services through the command line  
`AWS SDK`: Manage AWS Services programmatically  
`Access Keys`: Access AWS using the CLI or SDK  
`Audit`: Use IAM Credentials Report or IAM Access Advisor
