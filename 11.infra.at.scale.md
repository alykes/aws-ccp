## Section 11 - Deploying and managing infrastructure at Scale  

### Cloudformation  
- Declarative way of outlining your AWS infra  
- Cloudformation creates the resources in the right order for you  
- It is `Infrastructure as Code` (IaC)  
- Costs can be estimated  
- Changes go through code review  
- Can automate addition, modification and deletion of resources  
- No longer need to create resources manually  

Benefits:  
  - Infrastructure as Code  
  - Cost  
  - Productivity  
    - Ability to destroy/re-create resources on the fly  
    - Automated generation of diagrams from templates  
    - Declarative programming  
  - No need to re-invent the wheel  
  - Supports (almost) all AWS Resources  
    - For anything that isn't supported, you can use a `custom resource`  

**Cloudformation Stack Designer**  
Will give you a diagram from the template  
  - We can see all the resources  
  - We can also see all the relationships between the resources  

When using cloudformation in the UI, you can do the following:  
  - Template is ready - you have an existing template    
  - Use a sample template  
  - Create template in Designer  

- **Note**: You must always give a name to a stack! 

**Updating a cloudformation stack**  
- Once you upload the template into CF, you can `update` by going to the stack and clicking `update`.  
- When you upload the new template, it will create a **change set** which will display what will be added/updates/removed  
- If you see `Replacement = True`, then that resource will be deleted and recreated  

### AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK)  
Allows you to use your preferred programming language to define your infra  
The code is compiled into a `CloudFormation` template (JSON or YAML)  
It is then possible to deploy infrastructure and application runtime code together  
  - Great for lambda functions  
  - Great for Docker containers in ECS/EKS  

### Beanstalk Overview  
It is a Platform as a Service `PaaS`  
Typical Architecture:  
  - Web App Tier 3  
    - Load Balancer --> EC2 Instances --> RDS (or ElastiCache)  

Reasons to use Beanstalk:  
- You don't want to manage infrastructure  
- You want to spend more time deploying code  
- You don't want to be configuraing all the databases, load balancers etc  
- You don't want to worry about scaling  
- Most web apps have the same architecture, ALB + ASG  
- You also need to have consistency across environments  

Elastic Beanstalk is a **developer** centric view of deploying an application in AWS  
It uses the same components: EC2, ASG, ELB, RDS etc but it is all in one view  

It is a managed service, it is free but you pay for the underlying resources  
  - Instance config/OS handled by beanstalk  
  - Deployment strategy is configurable but performed by Beanstalk  
  - Capacity provisioning  
  - Load Balancing & auto-scaling  
  - Application Health-monitoring and responsiveness  

The developer/customer is only responsible for the application code  

There are three architecture models:  
  - `Single instance deployments`: good for `dev`  
  - `LB + ASG`: good for prod or pre-prod web servers  
  - `ASG Only`: good for non web apps in production (worker nodes etc)  

Support for many platforms:  
  Go, Java, .net, node.js, php, python, ruby, packer builder, containers  
  If it isn't supported, you can write your own custom platform  
  `Exam Tip` Health monitoring - agents push metrics to CloudWatch - checks for app health and publishes health events  

You can select `Web Server Environment` or a `Worker Environment`  
When you create the stack, ensure you have the `Service Role` and `EC2 instance Profile` defined  
Permissions for the instance profile, need to have:  
  - AWSElasticBeanstalkMulticontainerDocker  
  - AWSElasticBeanstalkWebTier  
  - AWSElasticBeanstalkWorkerTier  

When you submit the configuration for creation, the events tab will give you progress on what is happening. This relates directly to a cloudformation job to deploy the stack  

### CodeDeploy  
- When you want to deploy your application automatically  
- Works with EC2 instance as well as On-Premises Servers  
- It is a **hybrid** service, but you need to install the `CodeDeploy Agent`  
- Therefore instances must be configured ahead of time  

### CodeCommit  
It is a git repo  
Version controlled repository  
Dev are enabled to collaborate with each other  
Benefits:  
- Fully managed 
- Scalable  
- HA
- Private, Secured, integrated with AWS  

### CodeBuild  
Build code in the cloud  
Compiles source code, runs tests and produces packages that are ready to be deployed (eg, via codeDeploy)  
CodeBuild grabs code from CodeCommit, runs scripts and builds packages  
Benefits:  
- Fully managed, serverless  
- Scalable and HA  
- Secure  
- Pay-as-you-go pricing (build time is billable)  

### CodePipeline  
Connects all the Code* services together (CodeBuild, CodeCommit, CodeDeploy)  
This is the CICD tool  
Code --> Build --> Test --> Deploy  
Benefits:  
- Fully managed  
- compatible with codeCommit, GitHub and other 3rd party services  
- Fast delivery and rapid updates  
`Exam Tip` Whenever you hear orchestration of pipelines, think of AWS CodePipeline  

### CodeArtifact  
This is the artifact store for your builds from CodeBuild  
Software packages depend on each other to be built and new ones created  
Storing and retrieving these dependencies is called **artifact management**  
Benefits:  
- Secure  
- Scalable  
- Cost Effective  
- fully integrated with other AWS services  
- Works with gradle, npm, yarn, twine, pip, nuget, maven  

### CodeStar  
- **Quick way to get started with the Code Suite of tools**  
- It is a **unified UI** to manage software developer activities in one place  
- It has monitoring as well  
- You can __edit code in the web console__ with **AWS Cloud9**  
- It will create a bunch of things in the background, including:  
  - CodeCommit Repo  
  - CodeBuild Jobs  
  - CodeDeploy Jobs  
  - CodeDeploy Pipeline  
  - A bunch of cloudformation templates (based on whatever you have chosen to use)  
You can integrate with an external issue tracking system like Jira  
Click on the `IDE` tab to set up Cloud9

### Cloud9  
It's a cloud IDE (Integrated Development environment)  
- Used for writing, running and debugging code  
- It's cloud based IDE, good for pair programming, code collaboration in real-time  

### AWS Systems Manager (SSM)  
Helps manage your EC2 and on-Prem systems at scale  
This is a **hybrid** AWS service  
Allows you to get operational insights about the state of your infrastructure  
It is a suite of 10+ products  
Most important features are:  
 - Patching automation for compliance  
 - run global commands across the entire fleet  
 - store parameter configuration with SSM parameter store  
Works with Linux, Windows, MacOS and Raspbian  

**How systems manager works**  
When you create an **EC2 instance**, you need to create an `IAM instance profile` with permission to `AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore`  
Install SSM agent on the systems that we control  
Installed by default on Amazon Linux AMI and some Ubuntu images  
If an instance can't be controlled with SSM, it's probably an issue with the SSM agent  
`Exam Tip`: SSM Agent allows you to run commands, patch and configure servers across your entire fleet  

### SSM Session Manager  
Allows you to start a secure shell (ssh) on your on-prem or EC2 instances  
- no ssh access, bastion hosts or ssh keys needed  
- no port 22 needed (therefore better security)  
- supports linux, macOS and windows  
- sends session logs to S3 or cloudwatch logs  
`Fleet Manager` is where you can see all the **managed** instances  
`Session Manager` is where you go to connect to your instance, you have to click `Start a Session`    

Three ways to connect to an instance:  
  - EC2 Instance connect - open port 22, but you need ssh keys, they get temporarily uploaded to the instance  
  - Open port 22 and use ssh  
  - Session Manager - You need an Instance with permission to `AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore` 

### SSM Parameter Store
- Secure storage for configuration and secrets  
- API Keys, passwords and configurations  
- Serverless, scalable, durable, easy SDK  
- Control access permissions using IAM  
- Version tracking & encryption (optional)

### OpsWork  
This is a configuration Manager like Chef or Puppet.  
AWS OpsWork is like an AWS managed version of those configuration management tools  
It's an alternative to SSM  
Only provision standard AWS resources:  
  - EC2 instance, databases, load balancers, EBS volumes  
`Exam Tip`: If something mentions that Chef/Puppet or configuration management is needed, think Opswork  
The only reason that you would use opswork is if you already had existing manifests or cookbooks and wanted to continue doing so with an AWS Service
