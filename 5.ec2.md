## Section 5 - EC2  

### Budget Setup  

You need to allow access to IAM users for them to be able to see Billing.  
Log in as root  
Click on the user and select Account  
Find the heading `IAM user and role access to Billing information` and click `Edit`  
Select the `Activate IAM Access` tickbox and `Update`  
This allows any user who is an `Administrator` to have access to billing data


### Billing Page 

```
To see which services are costing money:  
Go into Billing  
Look for `Charges by service` to see which services are costing money  
```

- Free Tier page  
Under `Billing`, you can select `Free tier` to view how much you are using of the free tier services  

- Budgets page  
This is where you set up alerts based on spend for the account  
- Create a Budget  
  - Some templates you can use are:  
    - Zero Spend Budget (you can be notified via email if any spend is incurred, that is anything `> $0.01` ; good to tracking free tier)  
    - Monthly Spend Budget (you set a limit and are notified when **actual spend** hits `85%`, `100%` and if **forecasted spend** is going to hit `100%`)  


**EC2 - Elastic Compute Cloud**  

### Basics  
Elastic Compute Cloud  
It consists of a few common services:  
- `EC2` - pay-as-you-go server  
- `EBS` - storing data on virtual drives  
- `ELB` - distributing load across machines  
- `ASG` - scaling services using an Auto-Scaling Group  

Its fundamental to understand how the cloud works.  

### EC2 Sizing and configuration options  
- OS: Windows, Linux, MacOS  
- Compute: Power & Cores  
- RAM: amount  
- Storage:  
  - Network Attached - EBS & EFS  
  - Hardware Attached - EC2 Instance Store   
- Network: Speed of the card, Public IP  
- Firewall: Security Group Rules  
- Bootstrap script: EC2 User Data  

### EC2 User Data  
It's possible to bootstrap an instance using EC2 User Data Scripts  
`Bootstrapping` simply means launching commands when a machine starts  
The bootstrap script is only **run once**, when the instance first starts  
EC2 user data is used to automate boot tasks such as:   
- Installing updates  
- Installing software  
- Downloading common files from the internet  
- Anything else that you want it to do  
- The EC2 User Data Script runs with **root user** permissions!  

### Launching an Instance  
`EC2` -> `Instances` -> `Launch Instance`  
Free tier instance is `t2.micro`  
- Click on `Compare instance types` to review other instances that are available.  

- Create an SSH key:  
  - Choose RSA for most keys (ED25519 is not supported in Windows Instances)  
  - Choose `.pem` for Mac, Linux and windows 10+ else select `.ppk` for PuTTY  

- Create a Security Group  
  - Best practise to isolate this as much as possible  

- Configure storage  
  - Remember that `Delete on Termination` is set by default.  

- Under Advanced, confirgure `User data`  
  - Example:  
  ```
  #!/bin/bash
  # For use in User Data
  # Install httpd (Linux Version 2)
  yum update -y
  yum install -y httpd
  systemctl start httpd
  systemctl enable httpd
  echo "<h1>Hello World from $(hostname -f)</h1>" > /var/www/html/index.html
  ```  

  - Check the summary  
  Click `Launch instance`  

  ### Stopping an instance  
  AWS will not charge you for compute, only storage.  

  Note: When you stop and then start an instance, the public IP will `likely` change. **The private IP remains the same.**  

  Note: You can terminate a `running` instance.  

### EC2 Instance Types  
https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types  
- General Purpose  
- Compute Optimised  
- Memory Optimised  
- Accelerated Computing  
- Storage Optimised

**Naming Convention**
m5.2xlarge  
- `m` is the instance class  
- `5` is the generation  
- `2xlarge` is the size within the instance class  

**Need to know for the exam**  
- `General Purpose`  
  Start with T, M as well as Mac; t3, t2, M7a, M6i, M5   
  Great for a diversity of workloads  
  Balance between **compute**, **memory** and **networking**

### Security Groups  
In EC2 -> Network & Security  
Fundamental bit of network security for AWS  
  - They control flow of traffic, ingress and egress for EC2 instances  
  - Security Groups only contain **ALLOW** rules  
  - Security groups can reference **IP or other security groups**  

**Deeper Dive**  
- A security group acts as a `firewall` for an EC2 instance  
- They regulate:
  - Access to ports  
  - Authorised IP ranges - IPv4 or IPv6  
  - Control inbound and outbound  
  - Consists of Type, protocol, port range, soource and description.  
  - You don't need to know how to configure a security group for the exam.  

**Good to know about Security Groups**  
- can be attached to multiple instances  
- located down to region/VPC combination  
- they live ouside the EC2 instance, they aren't part of the instance itself  
- Maintain one seperate security group for ssh access  
- If you get a timeout, then it's probably a security group issue  
- If you get a connection refused error, then it's an application issue not a security group problem  
- By **default** all inbound traffic is **Blocked** and outbound traffic is **Allowed**  

**Reference Security Groups from Other Security Groups**  
Good for load balancers  

**Classic ports you need to know for the exams**  
22 SSH - Secure Shell  
21 FTP - File Trasfer Protocol  
22 SFTP - Secure File Trasfer Protocol  
80 HHTP - unsecured wed traffic  
443 HTTPS - secured wed traffic  
3389 RDP - Remote Desktop Protocol  

### SSH - Secure Shell  
|OS|Software|  
|---|---|  
|Mac|SSH|  
|Linux|SSH|  
|Windows < 10|PuTTY|  
|Windows >= 10|PuTTY or SSH|

**NOTE: You can also use EC2 Instance Connect for Amazon Linux 2 or Ubuntu 20.04 or later**  

**Set the private key permission to 400 (recommended)**  
**In windows, disable inheritance, add the user to the file or file as a full owner**  



### Instance Connect  
Select the instance in EC2, then select the orange `Connect` button.  
An ssh key is temporarily created for connection and therefore you don't need one or manage them.  
The security group still needs to have an SSH rule to allow comms in.  

### EC2 Instance Roles  
Never run aws configure on an EC2 instance, bad idea!  
Use IAM Roles instead.  
Attach the IAM role onto the EC2 instance  

Go to `EC2` --> `Actions` --> `Securty` --> `Modify IAM Role`  
Add the role with whatever permissions you require, now you can run aws commands to access those services!  
eg run the `aws iam list-users` to check whether or not you can see the users  

### Instance Purchasing Options  
- `On Demand` - short workloads, predictable pricing, pay by the second.  
- `Reserved` - 1 or 3 year term  
  - Reserved Instances for long workloads  
  - Convertible Reserved Instances - If you need to change the instance types during the contract period  
- `Savings Plan` - 1 or 3 year terms
  - Commit to an amount of usage in dollars, these are for long workloads  
- `Spot Instances` - Short workloads, cheap but can lose the instance at anytime, so good for stateless workloads  
- `Dedicated Hosts` - Rent an entire physical server and you control the instance placement  
- `Dedicated Instances`  
  - No one else will share the hardware  
  - reserve capacity in a specific AZ for any duration  


**On Demand**  
- Pay for what you use:  
  - Linux or Windows - pay for every second after the first minute  
  - All other OS - billing is per hour  
- Has the highest upfront cost  
- No long term commitments  
- Recommended for **short-term** and **un-interrupted** workloads where you can't predict how the application will behave.  

**Reserved Instances**  
- Discounts always change so you don't need to memorise them for the exam  
- Up to 72% off compared to On-Demand  
- You reserve specific instance attributes (Instance Type, Region, Tenancy, OS)  
- Reservation period - 1 year or 3 years (longer the term, the greater the discount)  
- Payment Options - Upfront, Partial Upfront, No Upfront (The faster you pay, the more discount you get)  
- Reserved Instance Scope - Regional or Zonal  
- Use it for steady-state applications things like a database  
- You can buy and sell reserved instances in the marketplace  

**Convertible Reserved Instances**  
- Can change your EC2 instance over the contract term; instance type, instance family, OS, scope and tenancy  
- Up to 66% discount  

**EC2 Savings Plan**  
- Get a discount based on long-term usage (up to 72%, same as a RI)  
- Commit to a monetary usage, eg ($10/hr for 1 or 3 years)  
- Usage beyond EC2 Savings Plans are billed at the On-Demand price  
- Locked to a specific instance family (eg M5) and AWS Region (us-east-1)  
- Flexible across:  
  - Instance Size (m5.xlarge, m5.2xlarge etc)  
  - OS (eg, Win or Linux)  
  - Tenancy (Host, dedicated, default)  

**Spot Instacnes**  
- Most aggressive discounting (up to 90% compared to on-demand)  
- You can lose the instance at any moment (if your **MAX** price is **less** than the **current spot price**)  
- They are the most cost-effecient instances in AWS  
- Useful for workloads that are resilient to failure (stateless)  
  - Batch jobs  
  - Data analysis  
  - Image Processing  
  - Any distributed workloads  
  - workloads with a flexible start and end time  
- **NOTE:** They are not suitable for critical jobs like databases! <-- `Exam Tip`  

**EC2 Dedicated Hosts**  
- You have access to the physical server itself and visibility into the lower level hardware  
- A physical server with EC2 instance capacity fully dedicated to you  
- Allows you to address **compliance requirements** and use can re-use your existing **software licenses** (per-socket, per-cpu, VM software licenses)  
- Purchasing Options:  
  - On-Demand - pay by the second for the active dedicated host  
  - Reserved - 1 or 3 years (Upfront, Partial Upfront, No Upfront)  
- The most expensive option  
- Good for complicated licensing models, (BYOL - Bring Your Own Licensing)  
- Good for compliance needs  

**EC2 Dedicated Instances**  
- Your own instance on your own hardware  
- Instances that run on hardware that is dedicated to you  
- May share hardware with other instances in the same account  
- You have NO control over instance placement (can move hardware after Stop/Start)

**Differences**  
|Characteristic|Dedicated Host|Dedicated Instance|
|---|---|---|
|Billing|Per-host billing|Per-instance billing|
|Visibility of sockets, cores, and host ID|Provides visibility of the number of sockets and physical cores|No visibility|
|Host and instance affinity|Allows you to consistently deploy your instances to the same physical server over time|Not supported|
|Targeted instance placement|Provides additional visibility and control over how instances are placed on a physical server|Not supported|
|Automatic instance recovery|Supported|Supported|
|Bring Your Own License (BYOL)|Supported|Partial support|
|Capacity Reservations|Not supported|Not supported|

**EC2 Capacity Reservations**  
- Reserve On-Demand isntance capacity in a specific AZ for any duration  
- You always have access to EC2 capacity when you need it  
- No time commitment (create/cancel at any time), no billing discounts  
- To get billing discounts, you need to combine it with Regional Reserved Instances and Savings Plans  
- You are charged the on-demand rate, whether you run the instance or not!  
- Sutiable for short-term, uninterrupted workloads that need to be in a specific AZ  

**Which purchasing option is right?**  
`On-demand` - short duration workloads that are permanent  
`Reserved` - Long lived workloads  
`Saving plans` - When you are going to spend a certain amount per hour  
`Spot Instance` - When you need some stateless instances that are good at short lived workloads  
`Dedicated Hosts` - When you have compliance, regulatory or licensing needs  
`Capacity Reservation` - You ensure that you have the capacity when you need it no matter what, it's always there and you pay for it, whether you use it or not  

### Shared Responsibility Model  
AWS  
- infra (global network security)  
- isolation on physical hosts  
- replacing faulty hardware  
- compliance validation  
Customer  
- security group rules  
- OS patches/updates  
- software and utilities on the instance  
- IAM roles assigned to EC2 & IAM user access management  
- Data security on your instance  

### Summary  
EC2 Instance: AMI (OS) + Instance Size (CPU + RAM) + Storage + Security Groups + EC2 User Data  
Security Group: FW attached to the EC2 instance  
EC2 User Data: Script to run when the instance is first launched (bootstrapping)  
SSH: Access to the instance  
EC2 Instance Roles: links to IAM roles to allow the instance access to specific AWS Services  
Purchasing Options: On-Demand, Spot, Reserved (Standard, Convertible), Dedicated Host, Dedicated Instances
