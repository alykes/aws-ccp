## Traditional IT Overview  

`Compute`: CPU, RAM  
`Storage`: Data  
`Database`: Structured data  
`Network`: Routers, switches, DNS  

__Terminology__  
Router sends and receives data packets between networks  
Switch sends data packets to server or client on network  

__Problems with the traditional approach__  
rent  
power/cooling and maintenance  
adding replacing hardware takes time  
scaling is limited  
Hire team for monitoring  
How do you deal with DR  

__What is cloud computing?__  
...is the on-demand delivery of compute, power, database storage, applications and other IT resources.  

**Benefits:**  
through a cloud service, you get pay-as-you-go pricing.
you can provision exactly what you want, right type and size of computing resources.  
access to resources almost instantly.  
simple way to access servers, storage, databases and a set of application services.  

AWS owns and maintains backend for these services, so you provision what you want, when you want and there is no need to concern for any back-end infra.  


### Cloud Models  
**Private:**  
  - single org, not exposed to the public  
  - complete control  
  - security for sensitive applications   
  - meet a specific business need  

**Public:** 
  - Azure, AWS, GCP (owned and operated by cloud service provider)  
  - 6 advantages (See below)  

**Hybrid:** 
  - keep some servers on prem and extend some capabilities to the cloud  
  - control over sensitive assets in your private cloud infra  
  - flexibility and cost effectiveness of public cloud  

### 5 characteristics of cloud computing  

- `On-demand self service`:  
  - Users can provision resources without intervention from the service provider.  
- `Broad network access`:  
  - resources availabe over the network and can be accessed by diverse client platforms.  
- `Multi-tenancy and Resource Pooling`:  
  - Multiple customers can share the same infrastructure and applications with security and privacy in place.  
  - Multiple customers are serviced from the same physical resource.  
- `Rapid elasticity and scalability`:  
  - Provision and de-provision resources when needed.  
  - Scale on demand quickly and easily.  
- `Measured Service`:  
  - Usage is measured and users pay for exactly what they have used.  


### 6 Advantages of Cloud Computing  
- `Trade CAPEX for OPEX`  
  - Pay on demand, don't own hardware.  
  - reduced TCO & OPEX.  
- `Benefit from massive economies of scale`  
  -  Prices are reduced as AWS is more efficient in terms of cost due to their large scale.  
- `Stop guessing capacity`  
  - scale based on measured usage.  
- `Increase of speed and agility`  
- `Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers`  
- `Go global in minutes`:  
  - by leveraging the AWS global infrastructure.  

### The Problems Solved by Cloud Computing  
- **Flexibility:** Change resources when needed.  
- **Cost-Effective:** pay as you go, for exactly what you are using.  
- **Scalability:** accommodate larger loads by making hardwarechoices and adding/removing additional nodes.  
- **Elasticity:** ability to scale-in and scale-out when needed.  
- **High-Availability and Fault-Tolerance:** build across DCs.  
- **Agility:** rapidly develop, test and launch software applications.  

### Types of Cloud Computing  
IaaS  
  - Provides building blocks for cloud IT  
  - network, computing, storage  

PaaS  
  - org doesn't need to manage underlying infra  
  - focus on deployment and management of apps  

SaaS  
  - complete product that is run and managed by a service provider  

On-Prem: Manage everything. 

IaaS: Virtualisation, Serers, Storage and networking managed by others.  
  - GCP, Azure, AWS  
  - EC2    

PaaS: Manage Data and Apps  
  - AWS Elastic Beanstalk  
  - Azure App Service  

SaaS: Manage nothing  
  - AWS Rekognition for ML  
  - GMail, DropBox, Zoom  

### Pricing Models  
AWS has three pricing fundamentals:  
  - Compute:  
    - Pay for compute time  
  - Storage:  
    - Pay for data stored in the cloud  
  - Network:  
    - Data transferred **out** of the Cloud only  

**This solves the expensive issue of traditional IT**  

### AWS Cloud History  
2002: Launched internally  
2004: Public offering with SQS  
2006: Re-launched with SQS, S3 and EC2  
2007: Launched in Europe  

### AWS Facts  
AWS is the leader (37%) followed by Azure (23%) and then GCP (9%) - as of Q4 2023  
AWS has lead the market for 13th consecutive years as of 2023  
Over 1 million active users  

### AWS Cloud Use Cases  
Enables you to build sophisticated, scalable applications  
Applicable to a diverse set of industries  
Use cases:  
  - Enterprise IT, Backup and Storage, Big Data analytics  
  - Website hosting, Mobile & Social Apps  
  - Gaming  

### AWS Global Infrastructure  
- AWS Regions  
- AWS Availability Zones  
- AWS Data Centres  
- AWS Edge Locations / Points of Presence  
- Refer to https://infrastructure.aws  

### AWS Regions  
Each **region** has many availability zones (usually 3; min 3; max 6) 
It is a cluster of DCs  
Most services are **region** scoped.  
Examples of regions:  
- us-east-1  
- ap-southeast-2  

### How do you choose an AWS Region?
- `Compliance`: Data governance and legal requirements (Data doesn't leave a region without your explicit permission).  
- `Proximity`: Where are the bulk of the customers, to try to reduce latency.  
- `Available Services`: Not all regions have all services and new features aren't always available in every region.  
- `Pricing`: This varies from region to region.

### AWS Availability Zones  
Each region has many **availability zones** (usually 3; min 3; max 6)  
- ap-southeast-2a, ap-southeast-2b, ap-southeast-2c  
Each AZ is one or more discreet DCs with redundant power, networking and connectivity.  
They are isolated from one another in case of disaster.  
They are connected with high bandwidth, ultra-low latency networking.  


### Points of Presence (Edge Locations)  
AWS has 400+ PoP (400+ Edge Locations & 10+ Regional Caches) in 90+ cities across 40+ countries  
Content is delivered to end user with low latency  

### Services  
**Global**  
IAM  
Route 53  
Cloudfront  
WAF  
**Regional**  
EC2  
Beanstalk  
Lambda  
Rekognition
