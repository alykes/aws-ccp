## Section 18 - Account Management, Billing & Support  

### AWS Organisations  
- Global Service  
- Allows you to manage multiple accounts  
- The main account is the master account  
- Cost Benefits:  
  - <code style="color : cyan">Consolidated billing</code> across all accounts - single payment method  
  - $${\color{cyan}Consolidated billing}$$ across all accounts - single payment method  
  - Pricing benefits from **aggregated usage** (volume discounts for EC2, S3)  
  - **Pooling of reserved EC2 instances** for optimal savings  
- API is available to **automate AWS account creation**    
- **Restrict account privileges using Sevice Control Policies (SCP)**  

### Multi Account Strategy  
- Create accounts by:   
  - department  
  - cost center  
  - dev/test/prod  
  - based on regulatory restrictions (using SCP) for better resource isolation (such as a VPC) to have **separate per-account service limits**  
  - isolated account for logging  

  - Multi-Account vs One Account and multiple VPC (Two Options)  
  - Use tagging standards for billing purposes  
  - Enable Cloudtrail on all accounts; send logs to a central S3 account  
  - Send Cloudwatch Logs to central logging account  

### Organisational Units  
- You can organise your accounts into different units for your billing strategy, such as:  
  - business unit  
  - environmental lifecycle   
  - project-based  

### AWS Organisation  
An example of an embedded OU structure  
Master Account +-> DEV OU  
               |-+ Prod OU  
                 |-> Finance OU  
                 |-> HR OU  

### Service Control Policies (SCP)  
- Allows you to allow or deny IAM actions  
- Applied at the **OU or Account level**  
- **SCP has no effect on the Master Account**  
- **SCP is applied to all the Users and Roles of the account including root**  
- SCP does not affect service-linked roles:  
  - service-linked roles enable other AWS services to integrate with AWS Organisations and can't be restricted by SCPs  
- SCP must have an explicit `ALLOW` (it doesn't allow anything by default)  
- Use cases:  
  - Restrict access to a certain service (eg, can't use Athena)  
  - Enforce PCI compliance by explicitly disabling services  

### SCP Hierarchy  
Any DENY rule overrides any Authorise rule that is further down the OU/Account structure.  

example:  
We have the following structure  

Root OU                         - FullAWSAccess SCP  
├─ Master Account               - DenyAccessAthena SCP  
└─── Prod OU                    - DenyRedShift SCP  
     └─── Account A             - AuthoriseRedShift SCP  
          ├─ HR OU              - DenyAWSLambda SCP  
          │  └─── Account B  
          └─── Finance OU  
               └─── Account C  

The results will be:  
**Master Account**  
 - Can do anything as the SCP doesn't apply to master  
**Account A**  
  - Can do anything  
  - EXCEPT access Redshift (explicit Deny from Prod OU)  
**Account B**  
  - Can do anything  
  - EXCEPT access Redshift (explicit Deny from Prod OU)  
  - EXCEPT access Lambda (explicit Deny from HR OU)  
**Account C**  
  - Can do anything  
  - EXCEPT access Redshift (explicit Deny from Prod OU)   

### Consolidated Billing  
- When enabled, provides you with two things:  
  - `Combined Usage`: combine usage across all AWS Accounts in the AWS Organisation to share:  
    - _volume pricing_  
    - _reserved instances_  
    - _savings plan discounts_  
  - `One Bill`:    
    - Get one bill for all AWS Accounts in the AWS Organisation  
- **The management account can turn off Reserved Instances discount sharing for any account in the AWS Organisation, including itself**  

### AWS Control Tower  
- Easy way to **set up and govern a secure and compliant multi-account AWS environment** based on best practices  
  - Benefits:  
    - Automate the set up of your environment in a few clicks  
    - Automate ongoing policy management using guardrails  
    - Detect policy violations and remediate them  
    - Monitor compliance through an interactive dashboard  
  - **AWS Control Tower runs on top of AWS Organisations**:  
    - It automatically sets up AWS Organisations to organise accounts and implement SCPs (Service Control Policies)  

### AWS Resource Access Manager (AWS RAM)  
- Share AWS resources that you want with other AWS accounts  
- You can share with any account that is in your organisation  
- Helps avoids resource duplication  
- Supported resources include:  
  - Aurora  
  - VPC Subnets 
  - Transit Gateway  
  - Route S3  
  - EC2 Dedicated Hosts  
  - License Manager Configuration  
  - etc  

### AWS Service Catalog  
- Users that are new to AWS may be overwhelmed and create stacks that aren't compliant in the organisation  
- Some users just want a quick **self-service portal**  to launch a set of **authorised products** which are **pre-defined by admins**  
- Can include: EC2, DB, storage etc...  
- Basically a pre-defined and authorised set of resources that are launchable by users in a self-service portal  

- Admins create `Products` (Cloudformation templates) and place them in `Portfolios` (collection of products)  
  - Admins then define `controls` on who can access which portfolios and products  
- Users log into a self-service portal, browse the `Product List` and launch then.  
  - They can then peruse their `Provisioned Products`  

### Pricing Models of the Cloud  
There are 4 pricing models:  
  - `Pay as you go`: pay for what you use, remain agile, responsive, meet scale and demands  
  - Save when you `reserve`: minimise risks, predictably manage budgets, comply with long-term requirements  
    - reservations are available for EC2 Reserved Instances, DynamoDB Reserved Capacity, ElastiCache Reserved Nodes, RDS Reserved Instance, RedShift Reserved Nodes

### Monitoring Costs in the Cloud - Billing Alarms and AWS Budgets  

- **Billing Alarms**  
  - Simple Alarm set on a CloudWatch metric    
  - Billing data metric is stored in CloudWatch `us-east-1`  
  - Billing data for overall worldwide AWS Costs  
  - Shows the actual cost, not projected costs  
  - Intended as a simple alarm (not as a powerful AWS budgets)  

- **AWS Budgets**  
  - **Creates a budget and sends an alarm when costs exceed the budget or when a forecast exceeds the budget**  
  - There are 4 types of budgets (Customise Advanced):  
    - Usage  
    - Cost  
    - Reservation  
    - Savings Plan  
  - For **Reserved Instances**  
    - Track Utilisation  
    - Supports EC2, Elasticache, RDS and RedShift  
  - Up to 5 SNS notifications per budget  
  - Can filter by:  
    - Service  
    - Linked Account  
    - Tag  
    - Purchase Option  
    - Instance Type  
    - Region  
    - Availability Zone

  - Same options as AWS Cost Explorer  
  - 2 budgets are free, then it's $0.02/day/budget  

### Cost Anomaly Detection  
- **Continuously monitors your cost and usage using ML to detect unusual spend**  
- It learns your unique, historic spend patterns to detect one-time cost spike and/or continuous cost increases.  
  - You don't need to define any thresholds  
- Monitor AWS services, member accounts, cost allocation tags or cost categories  
- Sends you the anomaly detection report with root-cause analysis  
- Get notified with individual alerts or weekly/daily summaries using SNS  

Process: `Anomaly Detection` -> `Create Cost Monitor` -> `Get Alerted` -> `Analyse Root Cause`  

### AWS Service Quotas  
- **Get notifications when you're close to a service quota value threshold**  
- Create **CloudWatch Alarms via the Service Quota console**  
- example: lambda concurrent executions
