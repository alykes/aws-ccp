## Section 12 - AWS Global Infrastructure  

**Why make a global application?**   
A global application is deployed in multiple geographies (either **regions** or **Edge Locations**)  
Benefits:  
  - Decreased latency  
    - deploy apps closer to the user base for a better experience    
  - Disaster Recovery  
    - If a region goes down, the app will still work by failing-over  
    - You need a DR plan in place to increase the availability    
  - Attack Protection  
    - a distributed global infrastructure is harder to attack  

### Global AWS Infrastructure  
`Regions`: For deploying applications and infrastructure    
`Availability Zones`: Made of multiple data centers  
`Edge Locations (Points of Presence)`: for content delivery to be as close as possible to the user base (used by Cloudfront - CDN)

### Global Applications in AWS  
- **Global DNS: Route 53**  
  - Great to route users to the closest deployment with the least amount of latency  
  - Good for DR strategies  
- **Global Content Delivery Network (CDN): Cloudfront**  
  - Replication part of your application to AWS Edge locations - to decrease latency  
  - Cache common requests for improved user experience and decreased latency  
- **S3 Transfer Acceleration**  
  - Accelerate global uploads and downloads for Amazon S3  
- **AWS Global Accelerator**  
  - Improve global application availability and performance using the AWS global network  

### Route 53
Managed DNS - Domain Name System  
- Help users get to AWS services via a URL  
Common record types:  
  - A IPv4  
  - AAAA IPv6  
  - CNAME host to host  
  - Alias example.com to AWS service  

`Exam Tip` Need to know routing policies for the exam  
Routing Policy Types:  
  - `Simple Routing Policy` - **No Health Checks**  
  - `Weighted Routing Policy` - Assign weights to instances to **distribute** the traffic; Route53 aka DNS takes care of how it responds to requests  
  - `Latency Routing Policy` - Based on **latency** and therefore usually associated with geographic location  
  - `Failover Routing Policy` - **Disaster Recovery**, you have a primary and secondary instance or service; if the primary fails, it goes to the secondary  

**You assign the policy when you set up the record in Route 53**  

### CloudFront  
**Content Delivery Network**  
- Improves read performance; content is cached at the edge  
- improves the user experience with reduces latency  
- currently 216 **P**oints **O**f **P**rescence  
- DDoS protection is enabled, there is integration with Shield, AWS Web Application Firewall  

**Cloudfront Origins**  
Cloudfront has several types of **origins**  
- S3 bucket 
    - For distribution and caching of files at the edge  
    - Enhanced security with CloudFront Origin Access Control (OAC)  
      - **OAC** - The Bucket can restrict access only to CloudFront  
    - This is replacing Origin Access Identity (OAI)  
    - Can be used as an ingress point to upload files into S3  

- Custom Origin (HTTP)  
  - Application Load Balancer  
  - EC2 instance  
  - S3 website (must be enabled as a static website)  
  - any HTTP backend  

Cloudfront highlevel architecture:  
  - A client requests content from a Cloudfront Edge Location  
  - If the Edge Location has the content it serves it to the user, if it doesn't it grabs it from the origin (S3 or HTTP etc)  
  - It then caches into the edge location  

Basically, users access the edge locations or PoPs. If the edge doesn't have the content, it goes back to the origin and grabs the content, caches it and serves it. Note that the origin (eg S3) is protected with OAC and a bucket policy making it secure.  

`Exam Tip`: Common question is; What is the difference between CloudFront and S3 Cross Region Replication  
  - CloudFront  
    - Uses the Global Edge network  
    - Files are cached for a TTL  
    - Great for static content that must be available everywhere  
  - S3 Cross Region Replication  
    - Must be setup for each region you want replication to happen in  
    - Files are updated in near real-time, so there is no caching  
    - It is read only  
    - Great for dynamic content that needs to be available at low-latency in a few regions  

Hands On  
  - When selecting Origin Access Control Settings, you need to `Create control setting` for OAC  
    - Once you create the setting, you will need to add the `policy statement` to the bucket once you create the distribution  
    - You can get the policy under `origins` tab, then click `Edit` and then go down to the `bucket policy` section to `copy` the policy  

### S3 Transfer Acceleration  
You would use this when you want to increase the transfer speed when moving files to and from an AWS Edge Location (which then forwards the data to an S3 bucket in the `target` region that you have specified when setting up the bucket)  
eg, you are in the USA and have a bucket in Sydney. When you transfer the file, it uploads to an Edge Location in the US (or the closest one) and then the edge location will forward that file to the bucket in Sydney. It means quicker transfers.  

You can use the test website to see if it will help with the transfer:

### AWS Global Accelerator  
- Leverage the AWS internal network to optimise the route to your application (approximately a 60% improvement)  
- improves global application availability and performance using the AWS Global network  
- Leverages Edge Locations to do all the routing  
- Creates **2 static Anycast IPs** for your application and traffice is sent through the edge location  
- Then the Edge location routes the traffic directly to your application  

**What is the difference between Global Accelerator and Cloudfront?**  
- Cloudfront:  
  - Improves performance for your cacheable content (like images and videos)  
  - content is served at the edge  
- Global Accelerator:  
  - No caching!  
  - Proxies packets at the edge to applications running in one or more AWS regions  
  - improves performance for a wide range of applications over TCP/UDP  
  - good for HTTP use cases that require static IPs  
  - good for HTTP use cases that require deterministic and fast regional failover

### AWS Outposts  
- Hybrid Cloud: businesses that keep on-prem infra alongside cloud infra  
- There are two ways of dealing with IT systems:  
  - One for the AWS Cloud (using AWS Console, CLI and AWS APIs)  
  - One for their on-prem infrastructure  
- AWS Outposts are `server racks` that offer the same AWS infrastructure, services, APIs and tools to build your own applications on-prem  
- AWS will set up and manage `outpost racks` within your on-prem infrastructure and you can start leveraging AWS services on-prem  
- The customer is responsible for the `Outpost Rack` physical security  

- Benefits:  
  - Low-latency access to on-prem systems  
  - local data processing  
  - data residency  
  - easier migration from on-prem to the cloud  
  - fully managed service  
  - integrates with a bunch of AWS services  

### AWS Wavelengths  
These are infrastructure deployments embedded within the telecommunications provider's DC at the edge of the `5G network`  
- Bring AWS services to the edge of the `5G networks`, EC2, EBS, VPC etc  
- `Ultra-low latency` applications through `5G networks`  
- Traffic doesn't leave the communication service provider's (CSP) network  
- High bandwidth and secure connection to the parent AWS Region  
- No additional charges or service agreements  
- Use Cases:  
  - Smart Cities, ML-assissted diagnostics, connected vehicles, interactive live video streams, AR/VR, real-time gaming  

### AWS Local Zones  
- Places AWS compute, storage, database and other selected AWS services closer to the end users to run latency-sensitive applications  
- Extend your VPC to more locations - `An extention of an AWS Region`  
- Compatible with EC2, RDs, ECS, EBS, ElastiCache, Direct Connect  
  - Examples:  
    - AWS Region: N.Virginias (us-east-1)  
    - AWS Local Zone: Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, Miami  
- Not all regions have local zones!  
- **To access the local zone, you need to create a subnet and then add it**  

### Global Applications Architecture  
- Single Region, Single AZ  
  - HA  
  - Global Latency  
  - Not Difficult  
- Single Region, Multi AZ  
  - HA  
  - Global Latency  
  - Minor Difficulty  
- Multi-Region, Active - Passive  
  - One Region is Active  
  - Active region is capable of read/write  
  - Passive region is generally only readable  
  - The Passive region will get data replicated to it  
  - Global Read latency is improved  
  - Global Write still have high latency  
  - Increased difficulty  
- Multi-Region, Active - Active  
  - Both regions are Active  
  - Both Active regions are capable of read/write  
  - Global Read latency is improved  
  - Global Write latency is improved  
  - Most difficul scneario to set up, manage and maintain
