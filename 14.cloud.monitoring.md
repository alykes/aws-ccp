## Section 14 - Cloud Monitoring  

### Amazon CloudWatch metrics  
- CloudWatch provides metrics for every service in AWS  
- **Metrics** are a variable to monitor (CPU Utilisation, networking ...)  
- Metrics have **timestamps**  
- You can create lots of metrics  
  - `EC2 Instances`: CPU Utilisation, status checks, network (not RAM)  
    - default is every 5 mins  
    - Option for detailed monitoring: It's more expensive the smaller the timeframe between metric gathering  
  - `EBS Volumes`: Disk Reads/Writes  
  - `S3 buckets`: BucketSizeBytes, NumberOfObjects, AllRequests  
  - `Billing`: Total Estimated Charge (only in us-east-1)  
  - `Service Limits`: how much you've been using a service API  
  - `Custom Metric`: Push your own metrics into CloudWatch  

### Amazon CloudWatch Alarms   
- Alerts are used to trigger notifications based on any metric  
- Alarm actions include:  
  - `Auto Scaling`: increase or decrease EC2 instances _desired_ count  
  - `EC2 Actions`: stop, terminate, reboot or recover an EC2 instance  
  - `SNS Notifications`: send notifications into an SNS topic  
- Various options (sampling, %, max, min ...)  
- Users can select the time period on which to evaluate an alarm  
- Create a billing alarm on Cloudwatch billing metric  
- Alarm States: **OK**, **INSUFFICIENT_DATA**, **ALARM**  

You can set up alarms directly on the service, eg, EC2 instances, you can click on create an alarm when looking at the list of all instances  

`Exam Tip` Billing alarm is only in **us-east-1** region! It will be under _Alarms --> Billing_  

### Amazon CloudWatch Logs  
- Collects log files from:  
  - `Elastic Beanstalk`: collection of logs from an application  
  - `ECS`: collection from containers  
  - `AWS Lambda`: collection from function logs  
  - `Cloudtrail` based on a filter  
  - `Route53`: log dns queries  
  - `Custom Agent`: on EC2 instances or on-prem servers  
- **Enables real-time monitoring of logs**  
- Adjustable CloudWatch Log retention  

**Cloudwatch logs for EC2 instances**  
- By default, **no logs** are collected from EC2  
- A CloudWatch agent is required to be running on an EC2 instance to push the logs into cloudwatch  
- **The CloudWatch Log Agent can be installed on-prem servers also**  
- You find this in CloudWatch, under _logs_  

### Amazon Event Bridge _(formerly Amazon CloudWatch Events)_   
- Schedule: Cron jobs (scheduled scripts)  
  eg, once every hour to trigger a lambda function  
- Event Pattern: Event rules to react to a service doing something  
  eg, IAM Root User Sign in Event ==> Create a message for an SNS Topic to notify subscribers  
- There are so many things that can be done, such as Trigger Lambda Functions, send SQS/SNS messages etc  
- From Eventbridge you can trigger so many other services to do something.  
- The above is the **default Event Bus** in AWS but you can get events from **Partner Event Buses** from datadog, zendesk etc
- You can set up your own **custom event bus**  
- `Schema Registry` to model the event schema  
- You can archive events (all/filter) sent to an event bus (indefinitely or set a time period)  
- Ability to **replay the archived events**  

### AWS CloudTrail  
CloudTrail provides:  
  - governance  
  - compliance  
  - auditing capabilities  

CloudTrail is **enabled** by default  
Get a history of events/API calls made within your AWS Account by:  
  - Console  
  - SDK  
  - CLI  
  - AWS Services  
You can push logs from CloudTrail into CloudWatch Logs or S3    
**A trail can be applied to ALL Regions (default) or a single region**  
If a resource is deleted in AWS, investigate CloudTrail first!!!  

### AWS X-Ray Overview  
- Debugging in production the traditional way:  
  - Test locally
  - Add log statements everywhere  
  - Re-deploy in production  
- Log formats differ across applications and log analysis can be difficult and time consuming  
- Debugging: one big monolith: `easy`, distributed services `hard`  
- No common views of your entire architecture  

**What X-Ray does**  
Visual analysis of your applications  
- **Advantages**:  
  - Troubleshooting performance (bottlenecks)  
  - Understand dependencies in a microservice architecture  
  - Pinpoint service issues  
  - Review request behaviour  
  - Find errors and exceptions  
  - Detect breaches of SLAs  
  - Discover where the bottlenecks are  
  - identify users/services that are impacted  

### Amazon CodeGuru  
It is an ML powered service that has two primary functions:  
  - Code Review  
  - Application Performance Recommendations  

- `CodeGuru Reviewer`: Automated Code Review for static code analysis (development)  
  - Checks commits for common best practises, resource leaks, security issues, input validation.
  - Uses ML and automated reasoning  
  - Hard-learned lessons across millions of code reviews on 1000s of open-source and Amazon repos  
  - Supports Java and Python  
  - Integrates with GitHub, BitBucket and AWS CodeCommit  
- `CodeGuru Profiler`: Recommendations about application performance during runtime (production)  
  - Helps understand the runtime behaviour of your application  
    - eg, identifies if you application is consuming excessive CPU capacity on a logging routine  
  - Features:  
    - identify and removes code inefficiencies  
    - improve application performance (reduce CPU utilisation)  
    - decrease compute costs  
    - provide heap summary (which objects are using up memory)  
    - anomaly detection  
  - Supports apps running on AWS or on-prem  
  - Minimal overhead on the running application  

### Amazon Health Dashboard  
**Service Health Dashboard**  

- Service History  
  - Shows all regions and all services health  
  - Shows historic information for each day  
  - RSS feed is available for subscription  
  - Previously called AWS Service Health Dashboard  

**Account Health Dashboard**  
- Your Account  
  - Previously called AWS Personal Health Dashboard  
  - Provides **Alerts and Remediation Guidance** when AWS is experiencing **events that may impact your account**  
  - Personalised view into the performance and availability of the AWS services underlying your AWS resources  
  - Dashboard displays relevant and timely information to help you manage events in progress and provides **proactive notification** to help you plan for **scheduled activities**  
  - **Can aggregate data from an entire AWS Organisation**
